00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,678
Hi, I'm Ben,
from Privacy Engineering,

2
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,815
and welcome
to Create your Privacy Nutrition Label.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,818
At WWDC 2020,

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,853
we announced privacy nutrition labels
to provide people

5
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:23,891
with an easily glanceable
and understandable summary

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,828
about how the apps they use
collect and use data.

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:32,032
In this talk, we'll discuss strategies
for creating an accurate label

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,667
and highlight some definitions

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,904
and examples to keep in mind
as you build your label.

10
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,974
Nutrition labels are one of many ways
you can communicate

11
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,776
your app's privacy practices,

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,680
in addition to a privacy policy
and App Privacy Report.

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,552
Labels can help you explain to people
how you use the data your app collects.

14
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,188
Additionally, sharing a label is
a requirement

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,523
for all apps in the App Store.

16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,793
On an app's nutrition label,
you can see data the app collects

17
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,297
that is used for tracking,
data that is linked to identity,

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,033
or associated with an account or profile,

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,135
and data that is not linked to identity.

20
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,439
In each section, the categories
of data collected are shown.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,578
Alternatively, if data is not collected,
an alternate label is shown.

22
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,747
From an app's product page
in the App Store,

23
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,184
you can also view a more detailed version
of the nutrition label

24
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,354
that includes the specific types of data
the app collects

25
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,189
and how that data is used.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,328
Today we'll be looking
at nutrition labels in more detail.

27
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,231
We'll walk through the process
for how to create your label

28
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,498
in App Store Connect,

29
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,168
and I'll share some resources
along the way.

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,039
Additionally, we'll provide
some more detailed definitions

31
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,377
and examples to help you
answer privacy questions for your app.

32
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,715
Let's begin with label creation process.

33
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,585
To create your label, you'll be asked
about what data your app collects,

34
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,090
use cases for each type of data,
and how that data is stored.

35
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,026
You might want to start
with creating an inventory

36
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,729
of your app's features
and data collection.

37
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,266
An inventory can be a helpful resource
for the next step,

38
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,469
where you'll enter information
about your app's privacy practices

39
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,604
into App Store Connect.

40
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,742
After you submit your label,
and as you update your data practices,

41
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,344
you should keep your label updated
as appropriate.

42
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,016
Lets dive right in and look
at how you can go about crafting

43
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,851
an inventory for your app.

44
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,254
When you submit
your label to App Store Connect,

45
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,691
you'll answer some questions
about how your app uses data.

46
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,361
You'll be asked about the categories
of data collected by your app,

47
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,530
the use cases for the data,

48
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,699
whether the data is linked to identity,

49
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,135
and whether the data is used for tracking.

50
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,905
However, as a developer,
you might not be thinking

51
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,941
about data categories in your app.

52
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,143
You're probably thinking about features,

53
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,046
and if you're not sure where to start
on building the nutrition label,

54
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,981
list out your app's features.

55
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,085
Then consider what data powers
each feature,

56
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:09,323
including what data is retained
and how that data is used.

57
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,426
You can then keep this list
as a reference for when you're asked

58
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,462
to enter specific details
into App Store Connect.

59
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,532
We recommend finding a framework
to document this information

60
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,702
that works for your app,
and you may have many strategies

61
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,438
to build an inventory
or other documentation.

62
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,575
When creating this inventory,
there are a number of resources

63
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,811
that you can use along the way.

64
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,281
Make sure to reach out to the stakeholders
working on your app.

65
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,884
For example,
you can check with your marketing team

66
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,852
to understand what data they use

67
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,623
and work with legal counsel to ensure
you document all data uses

68
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,758
described in your app's privacy policy.

69
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:49,863
We also recommend consulting
internal documentation in this process.

70
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,267
Consider looking
at your app's network traffic

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,304
using App Privacy Report
or a network proxy tool.

72
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,308
You can use this information to learn
what domains your app is contacting

73
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,877
and follow up with the owners
of those endpoints

74
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,146
to understand how data is being used.

75
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,883
Keep in mind that while a network audit
may be helpful in discovering

76
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,986
where your app sends data,
it is not comprehensive,

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,789
and you should use it
in combination with other strategies.

78
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,127
You should also audit any data
you retain on a server,

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,129
such as by reviewing database schemas

80
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,464
and checking what systems
have access to data.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,203
Additionally, make sure to check
with any partners

82
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,271
that may be processing your app's data,

83
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:34,541
as you are responsible
for declaring the collection practices

84
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,777
of all data collected from your app,

85
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,847
including data collected
by third-party SDKs,

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,984
analytics tools, advertising networks,
or other external vendors.

87
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,522
Many SDKs provide documentation
of their privacy practices,

88
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,859
and some provide specific guidance
for nutrition labels

89
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,395
which you can use to ensure
your label is comprehensive.

90
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,366
When building this inventory,
you might also discover

91
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,202
that there is data that you're collecting
that you don't need.

92
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:06,473
Inventorying your privacy practices
can be a way to identify opportunities

93
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:10,477
to make changes to your app's practices
by minimizing data collection,

94
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:14,581
processing data on device,
and storing data not linked to identity.

95
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,853
For some new technologies you can use,
see What's New In Privacy.

96
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,991
Once you've built up an inventory
or documented your data practices

97
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,592
through your preferred process,

98
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,795
you'll work though responding
to the questions in App Store Connect.

99
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:34,101
In App Store Connect,
account holders, admins, and app mangers

100
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,503
can enter your app's privacy label.

101
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,773
From your app's page,
open the App Privacy section.

102
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,578
First, you'll be asked
about whether your app collects data.

103
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,682
Data is considered collected when it
is transmitted off device in a way

104
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,386
that is accessible for longer than
to service the request in real time.

105
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,456
So if you or any of your partners
retain data about interaction with the app

106
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,560
on a server,
such as server logs, a user profile,

107
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,629
or analytics,
your app likely collects data.

108
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,101
We designed labels
to describe all data apps collect.

109
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,704
You should declare all data
collected by your app,

110
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,374
even if people agree elsewhere
to the data collection or use.

111
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,711
Labels are a supplement
to a privacy policy

112
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,779
and any requirements

113
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,849
for user transparency
or consent for data collection.

114
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,653
We recommend working with legal counsel
to evaluate those requirements.

115
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,823
If you do collect data,
you'll be asked to declare

116
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,125
the categories of data
collected from your app,

117
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,162
such as email address,
phone number, or payment info.

118
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,832
You'll then be able to preview
your label in progress

119
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,668
and provide more detail
for each data category.

120
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,505
Let's work on phone number.

121
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,342
For each category of data,
you'll be asked to declare what use cases

122
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,810
the data collection supports,

123
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,679
such as analytics
or product personalization.

124
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,649
You'll then be asked to disclose

125
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,851
whether data is linked
to a user's identity.

126
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,824
Data is considered linked to identity
if it is associated with an account,

127
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,059
device, or user profile.

128
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,263
This can be an opportunity
for you to evaluate whether you need

129
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:13,000
to store data linked to identity,
and whether you can store data

130
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,303
in a way that isn't linkable
to any account or profile.

131
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,741
Finally, you'll be asked
whether each data type is used

132
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,309
for tracking purposes.

133
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,680
"Tracking" refers to linking data
collected from your app

134
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:31,185
about a particular end user or device,
such as a user identifier,

135
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:35,222
device identifier, or profile,
with third-party data

136
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,825
for targeted advertising
or advertising measurement purposes,

137
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,161
or sharing data collected from your app

138
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,998
about a particular end user
or device with a data broker.

139
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,403
As mentioned earlier,
nutrition labels are intended to reflect

140
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,672
all data your app may collect,

141
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,074
even for features where people
using your app

142
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,344
agree separately
to data collection or use.

143
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:02,416
Ensure you disclose any data categories
used for tracking on your nutrition label.

144
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,485
Additionally,
as all tracking must be with permission,

145
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,389
adopt App Tracking Transparency
if appropriate for your app.

146
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,128
For more information about tracking,
see Explore App Tracking Transparency.

147
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:21,235
Once you've submitted this information
for all data your app collects,

148
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,238
you'll be able
to preview and publish your label.

149
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:29,142
Your label will be published immediately,
independent from any updates to your app.

150
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,179
Now that you've created your label,

151
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,982
let's consider
when you'll need to update it.

152
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,417
You can update your label at any time,

153
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,621
and aren't required to release
a new version of your app.

154
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,823
We recommend re-evaluating
your app's label

155
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,826
when releasing new features
and on an ongoing basis.

156
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,495
As you change how your app uses data,

157
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,064
ensure your label remains up to date.

158
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,066
If you're adding new features to your app,

159
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,871
implementing new or updated integrations
with third-party partners or SDKs,

160
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,541
or using already-collected data
in new ways,

161
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:04,077
make sure to evaluate
whether any label changes are needed.

162
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,916
Now that we've worked through the process
of building your privacy nutrition label,

163
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:14,087
we'll discuss some additional guidance
around policy definitions and examples.

164
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:18,392
All of this information is available
in the Apple Developer documentation.

165
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:23,430
Today I'll be highlighting a few examples
based on our experience at Apple

166
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,333
building nutrition labels
for our own apps,

167
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,403
and from some questions
we have heard from developers.

168
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:33,907
You might wonder
how to disclose use of IP address.

169
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,677
IP addresses can be used
for multiple purposes,

170
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,181
including as an identifier
or to infer approximate location.

171
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,051
Our guidance is to declare
the collection categories

172
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,554
based on what the IP address is used for.

173
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,024
For example, if you use IP address
to show local content

174
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,728
or for location analytics,
declare location.

175
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,266
Another area to note is the categories
including product interaction.

176
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,004
Product Interaction covers data
collected about the user's interactions

177
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,941
inside the app, such as information
about which screens people open.

178
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,979
Browsing history refers
to collection of activity

179
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:15,849
that is not part of the app,
such as an in-app browser.

180
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,119
Search History is searches
performed within the app

181
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,190
for any content,
both in the app or in in-app browsers.

182
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,127
Labels are intended
to comprehensively describe

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,862
the app's primary functionality

184
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,765
and features encountered
by all of your app's users.

185
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,035
However, there are certain types
of collection

186
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,271
that are optional to disclose.

187
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,541
Collection that is infrequent, optional,
and independent

188
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,043
from the app's primary functionality,

189
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,413
clearly discloses all collection
at submission time,

190
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:52,085
and has limited use purposes, for example,
not used for tracking or advertising,

191
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,021
may be optional to disclose.

192
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,158
Feedback forms and report-a-problem flows
are some features

193
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,927
that may meet these requirements.

194
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,264
Full details and requirements
for the optional disclosure policy

195
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:08,202
are available on the "App privacy details
on the App Store" page

196
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,637
in Apple Developer documentation.

197
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,439
And that's a wrap!

198
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,410
Here are four things to keep
in mind while building your label.

199
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:20,180
Make sure to reach out to all stakeholders
working on your app

200
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:24,051
to inventory your collection
and ensure your label is accurate.

201
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,255
Remember to include
all collection from your app,

202
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,791
including from SDKs and other partners.

203
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:36,763
If applicable to your app, ensure
you request permission for tracking,

204
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,967
in addition to disclosing
any use on your nutrition label.

205
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:45,305
Finally, when you update your app
or change how you use data,

206
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,040
ensure your label is updated.

207
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,077
Thanks for joining me today.

208
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,746
Privacy Nutrition Labels
are a way to build trust

209
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,548
with people who use your app

210
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,518
and help people
understand how you use data.

211
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,921
The Apple Developer Documentation
and App Store Connect

212
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,824
have even more information
to reference throughout the process

213
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,059
of building and updating your label.
