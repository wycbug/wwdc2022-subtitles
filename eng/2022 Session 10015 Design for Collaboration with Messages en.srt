Hello. My name is Jaewoo.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,213
I'm a designer on the Apple Design team.

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,116
Whether preparing Keynote presentations
with colleagues

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,485
or collecting ideas with friends,

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,289
people collaborate
on all types of things everyday.

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,092
To create a first-class
collaboration experience,

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,530
we made a handful of changes
to iOS 16 and macOS Ventura.

9
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,266
Today, I'm going to talk about
why we put Messages

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,235
in the center of our
collaboration experience

11
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,771
and walk you through an end-to-end
collaboration flow,

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,974
showcasing all the new changes we've made.

13
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,443
I'll also share a few considerations

14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,246
to help you design a great
collaboration experience in your app

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,048
using Messages.

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,318
Without further ado, let's get started.

17
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,556
Email is one of the great communication
tools that people use every day.

18
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,294
Many collaborative apps use email
as a primary way of connecting people.

19
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:05,566
However, chatting over email during
collaboration doesn't feel responsive.

20
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,037
That's because email was designed
as an asynchronous communication tool.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,274
So, we brought Messages
into collaboration to supplement email.

22
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,377
Messages allows people
to send collaboration invitations

23
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,780
using existing conversations.

24
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,016
No need to ask for email addresses.

25
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,887
Effective communication is a key
to successful collaboration.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,491
Messages already has many
great features to facilitate that.

27
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:36,363
Messages conversations can
also easily turn into FaceTime calls.

28
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,267
Talking over FaceTime and using
screen sharing can make collaboration

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,002
far more productive.

30
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,073
Let's take a look at how Messages
and collaborative apps work together.

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,941
My friends and I love baking,

32
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,278
and we often share recipes
with each other.

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,214
I'm working on a Pages document
with some recipes,

34
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,451
and I'd like to share it with my friends.

35
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:01,154
I'll start by tapping
on the share button in the toolbar.

36
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,324
The new system share popover allows me
to share this document

37
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,927
in two different ways.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,598
I can either start a new collaboration
or send a copy.

39
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,636
With the collaboration option,
I can send invitations using Messages,

40
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,939
Mail, or other communication apps.

41
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,010
My baking friends and I have
a chat group called Cupcake Designers.

42
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,914
The system share popover knows
I talk to them quite often

43
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,317
and show them as a conversation suggestion
in here.

44
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,487
I'll select the group
to start a collaboration.

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,790
The collaboration invitation is
now in the Messages input field

46
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,259
and is ready to be sent.

47
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,329
Send button kicks off
collaboration immediately.

48
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:46,800
If you look at the toolbar, you can see
the Cupcake Designers photo appeared.

49
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,771
The conversation is now linked
with this document.

50
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,107
Looks like my friends
Lauren and Chris just joined.

51
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,880
Tapping on the group conversation photo
brings up the collaboration popover.

52
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,885
This collaboration popover was added
for easy access to communication tools

53
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,255
and is also
a quick collaboration overview.

54
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,592
Pages displays
who's currently in the document.

55
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,261
Tapping on the Messages button
in the popover

56
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,365
brings the Messages conversation
over the shared document.

57
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,034
I can quickly go back
to the group conversation

58
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,504
and talk about this document.

59
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,306
If I need to talk to people over FaceTime,

60
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,043
I can simply tap on the audio
or video button in this popover.

61
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,115
Now, my friends and I can
make edits in real-time.

62
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,852
Tight integration with Messages
unlocks more superpowers.

63
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,589
Now Messages can display notifications
from collaborative apps.

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,461
Looks like Chris just made edits
to the Baking Recipes document.

65
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:53,300
This Messages banner allows me to directly
open the document and see the new updates.

66
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,337
Collaborative apps and Messages
now have a strong connection

67
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,874
to make collaboration workflows
more streamlined.

68
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:05,078
Okay, we looked at an example
of the new collaboration experience.

69
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,915
Starting a collaboration is simple
using the share button

70
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,517
and the system share popover.

71
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,655
People can easily drop invitations
in existing conversations.

72
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,691
And the collaboration popover
allows people to easily go back

73
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,562
to Messages conversations
or start FaceTime calls.

74
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,967
Edit notifications from collaborative apps
let people stay up-to-date.

75
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,005
Now that we've seen how Messages
and collaborative apps work together,

76
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,775
let's switch gears
and look at some practical tips

77
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:38,912
for how to design collaboration
into your app.

78
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,949
Starting with the system share sheet.

79
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:46,486
The people who use your app are
very familiar with the system share sheet.

80
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,458
They use it for all kinds of things,
including sharing websites,

81
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:56,296
songs and albums, photos,
and other types of content.

82
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,966
And conversation suggestions help people

83
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,769
quickly find destinations
of the content they are sharing.

84
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:07,407
The system share sheet gives people
an easy way to begin a collaboration.

85
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:12,346
It will help make collaboration
in your app more consistent and familiar.

86
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,716
If you do decide to take advantage
of the system share sheet,

87
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,887
the next step is to place
a share button in your app.

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,190
Put the button in a place
where people can easily access.

89
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,326
Toolbars are a good candidate.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,296
Now let's look more closely
at how you can customize

91
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,533
the share sheet for your needs.

92
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:37,237
The popup button in the header allows
people to choose how they share files.

93
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,007
If your app
doesn't support sending a copy,

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,743
then the popup button will be hidden.

95
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,646
"Everyone can make changes"
text below the popup button

96
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,383
is an entry point
to the collaboration permission settings.

97
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:54,288
You need to provide a descriptive copy
of default settings your app supports.

98
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:58,926
To avoid truncation,
be as concise as possible.

99
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,261
The permission settings screen
will be presented

100
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,464
when tapping on
"Everyone can make changes" text.

101
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:08,368
When customizing the screen,
keep the structure of choices simple

102
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:13,106
so people can easily skim the options
and make quick decisions.

103
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,443
The share popover
in macOS has been redesigned

104
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:22,282
to reflect the changes in iOS and iPadOS,
including the conversation suggestions.

105
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:27,054
The dropdown menu lets people choose
how they wish to share their files.

106
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,357
Permission settings are also
accessible within this popover.

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,993
Again, use a concise
permission summary string

108
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,429
and keep the settings simple.

109
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,932
Next, let's talk about
how to optimize the experience

110
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,935
of initiating collaboration in Messages.

111
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,404
People can choose not only how they share,

112
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:48,675
but also customize collaboration settings
from the Messages input field.

113
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,247
People don't need to go back to
the share sheet to change those options.

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,084
Using drag and drop to add a file
into a Messages conversation

115
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,654
is another convenient way
of starting a collaboration.

116
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:04,658
So help people easily set the permissions
from the Messages input field

117
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,895
and let them start a collaboration
with the send button.

118
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,164
And it's really important
to put the collaboration button

119
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,467
where people can easily find it.

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,569
Once people have begun collaborating,

121
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,273
the collaboration button
will appear in your app.

122
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,643
This collaboration button is one
of the most important UI elements

123
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,179
of the entire collaboration experience.

124
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:29,850
Find a place where it can stand out
and draw people's attention.

125
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,987
It's best to place the collaboration
button right next to the share button.

126
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,857
The appearance of the collaboration
button will be slightly different

127
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,460
depending on
how people started collaboration.

128
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,931
If people sent an invitation
to a one-on-one Messages conversation,

129
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,667
the recipient's picture
will appear as the button.

130
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,436
If collaboration started
with a group conversation,

131
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,338
and the conversation has a photo,

132
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,874
the system will show
the photo in your app.

133
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,577
If a group conversation photo
is not available,

134
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,314
a system provided symbol
will be used instead.

135
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,016
Once you decide where to put
the collaboration button,

136
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,087
it's time to customize
the collaboration popover for your app.

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,291
The collaboration popover
consists of three separate sections.

138
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,595
The top section shows
who you are collaborating with.

139
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,799
The system will find corresponding
profile pictures from the Contacts app

140
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,201
and display them here.

141
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,904
There are also buttons for communication.

142
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,474
If there is no Messages conversation
linked with the document,

143
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,344
the message button
will let you connect one.

144
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,181
The middle section is for you,
and it's fully customizable.

145
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,417
Think about what information
or functions will be essential

146
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,620
for people using your app.

147
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:43,590
Pages shows the active participant list
with a display setting.

148
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:47,828
In contrast,
the Notes app shows the latest activities

149
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,730
along with two action buttons.

150
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,199
Try not to overload
this collaboration popover

151
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,902
with too much information
or too many buttons.

152
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,004
Keep it glanceable.

153
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,574
Also make sure everything
you are adding here is visually consistent

154
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,143
with other elements in the popover.

155
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,380
If your app doesn't have
anything to show in this popover,

156
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,715
it's okay to leave
the middle section empty,

157
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,852
like Reminders and Files.

158
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,223
At the bottom of the popover,
there is the "Manage Shared File" button.

159
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,493
You can customize
the button label if needed.

160
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:23,230
This button opens
the collaboration management screen.

161
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,332
People can add and remove participants

162
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,268
and also change other settings
from this screen.

163
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,737
If your app is using CloudKit sharing,

164
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,074
the management screen will be
provided by the system.

165
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,076
If you're not using CloudKit sharing,

166
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,213
you can have your own
management screen for your app.

167
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:45,018
The collaboration popover on macOS
has the same structure as iOS.

168
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,255
Use macOS UI components
and design patterns

169
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,158
when customizing the middle section.

170
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,027
Lastly, you will want to give
special consideration

171
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,397
to the appearance of the banners
in Messages.

172
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:01,134
The banners in Messages are
how your app can notify collaborators

173
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,437
of important changes.

174
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,508
These banners allow people
to stay informed about new updates

175
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,843
without having to open the document.

176
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:14,081
Messages offers banner templates
for you to choose from.

177
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:18,218
Edits made, comments added,
you were mentioned,

178
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:21,121
and also files modified.

179
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,157
Tell Messages what type of updates
you want to display.

180
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,095
Those updates will end up
in the right conversations.

181
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,697
You might ask,
what if multiple people made

182
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,767
multiple edits
in many different documents?

183
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,870
How will Messages handle multiple banners?

184
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,973
To not clutter conversation
with too many banners,

185
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,544
Messages will consolidate
those banners into one.

186
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,980
When people tap
on the view button in this banner,

187
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:50,083
Messages will show all the updates
in one place

188
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,153
and let people choose
which one they want to open.

189
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,822
Okay, we've taken a look
at all the details

190
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:59,293
to design the best collaboration
experience using Messages.

191
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,463
Adopt the new system share sheet
for better collaboration initiation,

192
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,732
and customize the collaboration popover

193
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:10,204
to provide communication tools
and a good collaboration overview.

194
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,340
Let people enjoy a productive
and successful collaboration

195
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,609
with the Messages integration.

196
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:19,780
I hope all these updates help you
design a better experience for your app.
