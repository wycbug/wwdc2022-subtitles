Halden: Hello, I'm Halden.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,479
Lilian: And I'm Lilian.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,250
Halden: Today, we're going to show you
how to design an effective chart.

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,720
Lilian: Charts are powerful tools
for making your apps more engaging

6
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,555
and informative.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,192
People can use charts of
weather forecasts to make plans,

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,028
stock prices to make financial decisions,

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:32,766
and fitness data to reflect
on their activities and set new goals.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,701
Halden: When you design a chart in an app,

11
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,471
you first need to design
the app's experience.

12
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,041
By identifying your app's needs,
you can decide when to use charts,

13
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,645
how to use charts,
and what design system will unify them.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,683
To learn about this important first step
of the design process,

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,054
see this year's talk called
"Design app experiences with charts".

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:58,292
Lilian: In this talk, we'll dive into
the next part of the design process:

17
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,527
how to design a chart.

18
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,398
In particular,
designing an effective chart,

19
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,435
which means a chart that's focused on
what you want to communicate,

20
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:12,339
approachable, and accessible
for people with disabilities.

21
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,476
To do that, we'll walk through
the design of a chart in an app for

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,213
a food truck
selling international pancakes

23
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,282
in San Francisco and Cupertino.

24
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,652
This finished app has
an entire system of charts

25
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,188
to help plan and manage pancake sales.

26
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,658
Today, we'll focus on how to design
one of these charts,

27
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,462
which visualizes pancake sales
over the last 30 days.

28
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,832
Halden: Good chart design begins
with identifying the chart's goal.

29
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,635
For this page in our app,
our goal was communicating:

30
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,304
"how were pancake sales
in the last 30 days?"

31
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,441
Goals like this can go in many directions.

32
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,278
It might be useful for our food truck
owners to see the pattern of recent sales

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,081
to understand how sales have fluctuated
or their range,

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,017
to get an idea of how big
these fluctuations were.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,522
Identifying values could be useful
to examine specific days.

36
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:06,126
Other insights of interest
could be maximum sales, outlier days,

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,429
or comparisons between days of the week
or location.

38
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,598
The list can go on and on.

39
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,269
Which of these insights are most important
for our food truck owners?

40
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,739
An effective chart focuses on
a few key pieces of information.

41
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,308
Design charts with intention.

42
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,177
With regards to pancake sales,

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,014
our food truck owners primarily want to
examine how their sales fared over time

44
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,416
and on specific days.

45
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,719
That means we'll want to focus
on communicating pattern,

46
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,722
range, and values.

47
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:39,326
How did we get from
these three priorities to this chart?

48
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,063
Let's walk through the design process
step by step.

49
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,134
Lilian:
Our design process involves five topics.

50
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,003
Marks, which are a chart's
visual building blocks,

51
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,272
like the bars in a bar chart.

52
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,509
Axes, to provide framing for these marks.

53
00:02:55,542 --> 00:03:00,280
Descriptions, which make charts more
approachable and easy to interpret.

54
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,684
Interaction,
which empowers deeper exploration of data

55
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,086
and is critical to accessibility.

56
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,622
And color, which adds personality,

57
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,824
and, as we'll show with a second chart,

58
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,527
can also enhance clarity.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,097
Halden: Our first step is to figure out
what kind of form we want for our chart,

60
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,868
using the visual building block
of charts called marks.

61
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,036
A mark is the bar in a bar chart,

62
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,740
the line in a line chart,
and the point in a scatterplot.

63
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,444
They're the visual elements
that represent items in data.

64
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,246
There are many kinds of marks,

65
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,580
and with any one mark,

66
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:37,651
you have a rich variety of ways
to express data.

67
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,953
Take bars, for example.

68
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:44,925
You can line them up
to represent data's change over time.

69
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,394
You can stack them to show proportions:

70
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,064
how different categories add up
to a total.

71
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,001
Or you can put them side by side
to compare values

72
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,870
between different categories.

73
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:01,975
These are just a few examples of the many
rich ways you can express data with marks.

74
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,913
So what options make sense for our chart?

75
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:10,384
When it comes to marks, you need
to design for your goals and data.

76
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,954
As we decided earlier,
our chart should focus on three insights

77
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,857
about pancake sales in the last 30 days:

78
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,394
pattern, range, and individual values.

79
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,431
As we choose our mark,
we'll pay close attention to pattern.

80
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,668
It would be useful for our food truck
owners to see any fluctuations

81
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,003
or trajectories in their sales.

82
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,472
We'll start with time
on the horizontal axis

83
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,175
and pancake sales on the vertical axis.

84
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,979
These axes are incomplete;
we'll fill them in later.

85
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:44,418
One option for a mark is to use points
to represent each day of pancake sales.

86
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,856
When we envision nice smooth data for
the chart like this, points look great!

87
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,526
But real data is rarely this neat.

88
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,195
With realistic data,
we can see that using points

89
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,698
makes it difficult
to make out any pattern.

90
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,668
It's important to test your designs
with real data early.

91
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,638
While point marks are a great
at revealing some insights,

92
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,641
such as identifying outliers
or clusters in data,

93
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,211
our needs call for something else.

94
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,514
To make the pattern of sales
easier to see,

95
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,850
we can connect sales counts
by using a line mark.

96
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,720
Lines are great
at representing rates of change.

97
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,090
Here, patterns and trajectories are clear.

98
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,691
But what if, in one month,

99
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,562
our food truck needed to close
for five alternating days?

100
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,132
In this situation,
the pattern of sales becomes less clear

101
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,701
because the segments connecting
far-apart values

102
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,738
become more prominent
than the values themselves.

103
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:42,376
Remember to design for a variety
of scenarios in your data.

104
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,445
Bar marks are a more flexible option
for our chart.

105
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,049
Here, zeros are visible
without creating a distraction.

106
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,418
This chart is also intuitive to read:

107
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,687
more white means more sales.

108
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,522
Since sales are cumulative,

109
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,125
the visual weight of all the bars
corresponds directly

110
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,228
to the number of sales made
in the last 30 days.

111
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,131
Lilian: Great!

112
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:08,235
We've chosen a mark that makes the pattern
of pancake sales visually apparent.

113
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:12,306
But we also need to follow
an important tenant of accessible design:

114
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,675
for all information you show visually,

115
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,779
you also need to design
how to represent it non-visually.

116
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,349
In other words,
you need to make sure these marks

117
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,120
and the information they represent
are also accessible with VoiceOver.

118
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,223
VoiceOver is a screen reader.

119
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,460
It lets people read information on
their screen through Braille or speech

120
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,564
so people who are blind and others
can use apps without needing to see.

121
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,102
VoiceOver: 1,234 pancakes.

122
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,605
Lilian: You can use VoiceOver
to navigate content,

123
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,206
like the elements on a chart.

124
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,676
VoiceOver: May 8th.
54 pancakes.

125
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,713
May 9th. 36 pancakes.

126
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,749
One year, button two of two.

127
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,852
Lilian: You can also use it to interact.

128
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,955
VoiceOver:
Selected: one year, two of two.

129
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,592
Lilian: And through a feature
called audio graphs...

130
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,794
VoiceOver: Audio graph.

131
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,797
Lilian: Play a sonification of the chart

132
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,100
VoiceOver: Play audio graph.

133
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:18,138
[phone chiming]

134
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,075
Complete.

135
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,412
Lilian: To make your chart's marks
non-visually accessible,

136
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,384
you need to 1. design how VoiceOver
will navigate over data values,

137
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,587
and 2. use audio graphs.

138
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,591
Conveniently, charts implemented
with the Swift Charts API

139
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,962
automatically include customizable
accessibility labels for marks

140
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,199
and an implementation of audio graphs.

141
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,968
To learn more about audio graphs
and Swift Charts,

142
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,270
check out developer documentation,

143
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,707
last year's talk "Bring accessibility
to charts in your app",

144
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,511
and this year's talk,
"Hello Swift Charts".

145
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,312
Nice!

146
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,647
We've designed our marks
for our goals and data,

147
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,650
and made them accessible in VoiceOver.

148
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:07,354
With our decisions,
we addressed one part of the question,

149
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,923
"how were pancake sales
over the last 30 days?"

150
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,326
Specifically, their pattern.

151
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:17,231
Now our food truck owners can see
recent fluctuations in their sales.

152
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,200
But what about the range
of these fluctuations,

153
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,103
and values on specific days?

154
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,339
Halden: For that, we'll design axes.

155
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:29,409
Axes frame marks to provide references
for their values.

156
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,713
For example,
in our chart of pancake sales,

157
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,849
when we label the horizontal axis
with the start and end dates,

158
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:41,522
it becomes clear that our chart shows
the 30 days from May 8th to June 6th.

159
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,357
What about the vertical axis?

160
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,327
The values here are entirely dependent
on the sales of the food truck.

161
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,898
With axes like this,
it's important to consider the range.

162
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,867
A range can be either fixed or dynamic.

163
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,703
An example of a fixed range
is the vertical axis

164
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,872
of the battery chart in the Settings app.

165
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:03,410
We know that the battery level
will always go from 0 to 100%.

166
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:07,214
Fixing the vertical axis to this range
helps us see, at a glance,

167
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:11,151
when the battery is full, empty,
or somewhere in between.

168
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,488
While it'd be confusing to change
the vertical axis range for this chart,

169
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,857
it can be necessary for others.

170
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,426
Consider the step count chart
in the Health app,

171
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,562
which uses a dynamic range.

172
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,830
There is no fixed maximum step count,

173
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:28,402
so it makes sense to dynamically adapt
the vertical axis range to fit the data.

174
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,171
This way,
even when the step counts are low,

175
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,241
the bars can make full use of
the vertical space available,

176
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,978
making fluctuations easier to see.

177
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,114
Let's return to our chart
on pancake sales.

178
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:45,819
As with steps, there is no limit to how
many pancakes the food trucks will sell.

179
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:49,189
So let's use a dynamic range
to automatically adapt

180
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:52,359
the upper bound
of our vertical axis to our data.

181
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,696
Notice how we still fix
the lower bound to 0.

182
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,066
Doing so is generally a good idea
when using bar marks

183
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,835
as it keeps the heights
of the bars meaningful.

184
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:06,740
This way, a bar that's twice as tall
as another has twice as many sales.

185
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,444
While labels for the lower
and upper bounds of each axis are helpful,

186
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:15,115
we still need more structure to interpret
sales in the middle of the chart.

187
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,084
That leads to our next concept.

188
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,655
We need to tailor the density
of our axis grid lines and labels.

189
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,259
Grid lines give you reference points
to estimate the values of marks.

190
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:30,230
The more grid lines you have,
the easier it is to estimate these values.

191
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,166
Some charts don't need grid lines
and labels at all,

192
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,636
such as this trend platter
in the Health app.

193
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,573
These charts tend to be sneak peeks
of larger charts in another view,

194
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,776
so an idea of the data's pattern
is all you need.

195
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,579
Grid lines and labels
would add distraction.

196
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,415
Grid lines and labels appear
in the follow-up detailed chart,

197
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,919
where you may want to analyze values
more precisely.

198
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,288
Earlier, we pointed out
that our food truck owners

199
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,325
want to examine the range
and values of their sales.

200
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,328
Right now,
we have two horizontal grid lines:

201
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:06,233
one at zero and another at roughly the
maximum number of sales for the month,

202
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:10,838
which is too few for estimating the range
of sales in the middle of the chart.

203
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:15,108
At the same time, too many grid lines
and labels can be distracting.

204
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,913
Here, having seven horizontal grid lines
might be overwhelming.

205
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,016
Balance these factors to choose
the appropriate density.

206
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,586
For our chart's context and intended use,

207
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,689
it's more effective to use around
four horizontal grid lines

208
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,559
and adjust
as the range of the axis changes.

209
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,195
Note that as we place
these grid lines and labels,

210
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:38,298
we use intuitive values
to make the chart approachable–

211
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:41,535
in this case, multiples of 20.

212
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:46,607
In the same way, it's intuitive for people
to read time in steps of seven days,

213
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,944
which gives us
five grid lines for a 30-day period.

214
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,114
So we've designed our axes
by considering their range

215
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,717
and tailoring the density of grid lines
and labels.

216
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,853
We've gone a long way towards
making our chart effective,

217
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,022
but charts are complex visual elements,

218
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,192
and our example still needs work
before it's approachable.

219
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,828
How can we convey the meaning
behind the marks and axes

220
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,831
in a way that's quick and intuitive?

221
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,301
Lilian: That brings us
to our next topic: descriptions.

222
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,471
Descriptions are important
for framing the intent of our chart

223
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,207
and making it approachable and accessible.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,410
Use descriptions,
or text preceding the chart,

225
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,947
to provide context to make
the chart more approachable.

226
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,319
They can make it clear that our chart is
about pancake sales in the last 30 days.

227
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,688
This text can be brief
and should be a part of

228
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,790
the user interface around a chart.

229
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,593
When we look at this chart
in the UI of our app,

230
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,864
the screen's title "Total Sales"
already gives some context,

231
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,134
and the label on the segmented control
that says "30 Days"

232
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,137
quickly establishes our time range.

233
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,772
That's a start.

234
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:56,176
Something else we need to clarify
is what the vertical axis is showing.

235
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,345
Are we looking at sales in terms of money?

236
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,814
In number of pancakes?

237
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,884
One solution could be adding
an axis label.

238
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:08,488
We can write "Pancakes sold"
above the vertical axis.

239
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,358
But here it's small and off to the side.

240
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,094
We want the meaning of this chart
to be obvious.

241
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:18,065
An alternative is to contextualize
the data with a title.

242
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,935
By using "Pancakes sold"
as a heading for the chart,

243
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,606
the chart's meaning is front and center.

244
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,610
Providing this context is important
for framing the chart.

245
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,246
We can make these descriptions
even better

246
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,015
by summarizing the main take-away
of the chart.

247
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,451
A lot of charts use this approach.

248
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,488
For example, the text above
a precipitation chart in Weather

249
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,290
describes its main take-away.

250
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,027
In this example,
it's: "Light Rain Forecasted–

251
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,164
Light rain is expected to start
in 9 minutes and last for 36 minutes"

252
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,868
There are many ways to present takeaways,

253
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:59,106
from sentence descriptions
to glyphs comparing historical data.

254
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,375
We'll take a simple approach
for our chart.

255
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,777
Let's bring out a main take-away
for our chart

256
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,779
by rewriting our chart title

257
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:10,951
to say "Total Sales: 1,234 Pancakes".

258
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,188
This description grounds our chart
with a concrete value

259
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,424
and summarizes
the most critical information.

260
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,027
Providing descriptions
that contextualize the data

261
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,131
and summarize key take-aways
eases readers into your charts.

262
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,968
It makes a chart more approachable
and accessible for everyone.

263
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,237
It sets up what to expect or look for,

264
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,106
which can be especially helpful
for people with certain disabilities

265
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,577
that make examining the details
of the chart particularly time consuming

266
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,445
or challenging.

267
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,514
Speaking of accessibility,

268
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:45,419
using audio graphs for our chart adds
important descriptions for VoiceOver.

269
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,188
With audio graphs...

270
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,890
VoiceOver: Audio graph.

271
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,059
Lilian:
VoiceOver can non-visually describe

272
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,927
what the axes are.

273
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,896
VoiceOver: Describe chart.

274
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,600
The x-axis is time. The y-axis is sales.

275
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,269
There is one data series.

276
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,272
Lilian: Audio graphs also provide
several summaries about the data,

277
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,274
including one you can customize.

278
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:11,478
These descriptions,
especially of the x and y axes,

279
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,615
are critical for non-visually
communicating the chart.

280
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,683
If audio graphs isn't an option,

281
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:20,554
make sure VoiceOver still has immediate
access to these types of descriptions

282
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,191
some other way,
like through accessibility text labels.

283
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,728
Halden: Now that we provide context,
summarized the main take-away,

284
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,931
and use audio graphs or an equivalent
source of descriptions,

285
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,267
our chart has all its essential parts.

286
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,571
But we could make it
even more effective with interaction.

287
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,541
You can design interaction
to empower people to explore

288
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:43,043
and understand their data
at a deeper level.

289
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,381
For example, you can use interactions
to highlight sections of a chart

290
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,851
to explore how their data fits
in a broader context,

291
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:55,956
or toggle between days,
weeks, months, and years.

292
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,627
We have an opportunity to enhance
our pancake sales chart with interaction.

293
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:03,430
Our food truck owners would find it
useful to see exactly

294
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,900
how many pancakes were sold
on a particular day.

295
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,503
We can offer that
with an interactive tooltip,

296
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:13,941
which lets us touch the chart to highlight
and read these specific values.

297
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,844
To make these touch-based interactions
easy to use,

298
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,546
make sure to use large touch targets.

299
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,784
So instead of making touch targets
on our chart the same size as our marks,

300
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,521
adding padding and stretching targets
to the full height of the chart,

301
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,657
makes it easy to use our tooltip because
you can touch any part of the chart

302
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,293
including the white space above the bars.

303
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,165
Lilian:
Interaction isn't only about touch.

304
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,301
People use a variety of other ways
to interact with devices,

305
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,805
depending on factors
like situation or disability.

306
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,774
So you need to design
for multiple types of input

307
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:50,777
to make chart interaction approachable
and accessible.

308
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:55,749
In other words, for every interaction
you design for touch or mouse clicks,

309
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:59,853
you need to design the same experience
for inputs like keyboard,

310
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:04,591
Voice Control,
Switch Control, and VoiceOver.

311
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,794
As you design these interactions,
it's important to make changes

312
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,396
on the screen visible,

313
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,865
like sizing the focus indicator
for Switch Control

314
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,700
or VoiceOver to be large,

315
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,703
the same way
we designed our touch targets.

316
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:22,109
Part of providing support for VoiceOver
is that you also need to design

317
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,312
good accessibility labels.

318
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,281
Recall how when we designed our marks,

319
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:31,852
we made sure VoiceOver can navigate
the chart's data values.

320
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,556
We made it so that when VoiceOver
navigates onto one of the bars,

321
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:40,661
it reads out values like
"June 1, 36 pancakes".

322
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:44,598
Let's examine what makes this label
a good design.

323
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,233
It's succinct.

324
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:51,505
We don't repeat unnecessary information,
like the axis names "Time" or "Sales"

325
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,875
which audio graphs already describes.

326
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,512
We spell out entire words
instead of using abbreviations.

327
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:04,151
That way, VoiceOver reads out
"June" instead of "Jun" or 6-dash-1,

328
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:08,455
and we make it clear
that 36 is the number of pancakes.

329
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,558
We also order the contextualizing
data value,

330
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,828
in this case, the date,
to come first.

331
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:19,466
This ordering makes it easier
to quickly look for a specific value.

332
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,136
VoiceOver: May 27th.
May 28.

333
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,907
May 29.
May 30th, 41 pancakes.

334
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,543
Lilian: It also makes the data
easier to interpret,

335
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,412
especially since you can jump
to different parts of the chart

336
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,782
and getting the context first
lets you know where you are.

337
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:42,856
The kind of labels you design
depend a lot on the goals of the chart.

338
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,661
For example, the charts on elevation
changes in cycling routes from Maps

339
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,663
don't show individual values,

340
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,633
but a route's pattern of elevation
gains and losses,

341
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:57,571
and use many vertical bars–
too many to navigate over individually.

342
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:03,710
A well-designed accessibility label
could then label a section of bars with:

343
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:07,014
"From 3.6 miles to 4.4 miles:

344
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:11,118
Climb 100 feet, descend 5 feet".

345
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,988
In contrast, if a chart is a tiny preview
inside a button

346
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,424
for opening the same chart in more detail,

347
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,327
it might make sense
to summarize the entire button,

348
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,764
chart and all, with one label.

349
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:27,835
Now that we've designed our interactions
to serve the focus, approachability,

350
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,670
and accessibility of our chart,

351
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,439
there's one more topic
we'd like to talk about.

352
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,874
Halden: Color.

353
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,411
Color can add personality
and enhance clarity in a chart.

354
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,547
So far, we've been designing
in black and white.

355
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,417
Color can give our chart
more pop in our app.

356
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,453
But it can also convey so much more.

357
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,922
You can use color
to distinguish categories,

358
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:52,259
as with the three activity rings
in the Fitness app.

359
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,895
You can also use it
to communicate intensity,

360
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,764
such as heat in a weather forecast.

361
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,401
You can even remove color
to draw attention to features of a chart.

362
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,370
Here the health app does so

363
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,673
to highlight your minimum and maximum
heart rate within a day.

364
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,677
Consider using color to enhance.

365
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,381
You ideally use color as an addition
to make the chart easier to understand

366
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:18,485
and not the only means
to convey critical information.

367
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,390
To help explain, let's use a scenario
of tracking two food trucks in our app:

368
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,427
one in San Francisco
and the other in Cupertino.

369
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:30,697
We want to modify our total sales chart
to allow us to compare sales

370
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,366
in these two locations.

371
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,034
How do we do this?

372
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,370
We could use a line for each city's sales,

373
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,006
but we can't tell which line
belongs to which city.

374
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,142
No label or layout distinguishes the two.

375
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:45,846
We can clarify the association
by placing a symbols on each line

376
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:48,248
to mark individual days.

377
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:52,152
Here we use circles for San Francisco
and squares for Cupertino.

378
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:54,855
Notice that we need a legend now.

379
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:57,491
We can add color
to enhance this difference.

380
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:00,894
It's important that color is added
on top of the symbols here.

381
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:05,299
Some people with colorblindness may not be
able to distinguish the lines otherwise.

382
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,968
This practice is especially important
for system settings

383
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,971
like Differentiate Without Color.

384
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,273
When choosing colors to represent data,

385
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,475
there are a few things to consider.

386
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,046
First,
consider how color can carry meaning.

387
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,617
For example, red and green
for low versus charged battery levels.

388
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,854
Culture can inform
the meanings of colors too.

389
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,990
In the US,
it makes sense to color code Stocks

390
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,961
with green for gains and red for losses.

391
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:37,598
In some countries like China, however,
people expect the opposite,

392
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,934
with red indicating gains
and green indicating losses.

393
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,340
For our chart,
system blue and green work well.

394
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:50,677
There is no obvious meaning tied to
these colors in the context of cities.

395
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,813
But what if we wanted to customize
the colors

396
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,115
to match the look and feel of our app?

397
00:21:57,084 --> 00:22:00,754
When choosing colors for categories,
balance visual weight.

398
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:05,659
If one color overpowers the other,
a hierarchy can be implied.

399
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,328
Say we started with a deep purple
for San Francisco

400
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:11,365
and this vibrant pink for Cupertino.

401
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:15,269
Notice how in this case
the prominence of Cupertino's pink

402
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:18,272
compared to the darkness
of San Francisco's purple

403
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,974
makes Cupertino look more important.

404
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:25,913
We can fix that by evening out
the saturation and luminosity.

405
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:26,980
That's better.

406
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,216
And while these color choices
still need some work,

407
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,586
now they have equal weight
and don't suggest one city as primary

408
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,122
and the other, secondary.

409
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:39,359
Note that adjusting color
for visual weight is a tool.

410
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:42,062
Sometimes it's useful to use a color
with more visual weight

411
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:46,366
when we want to draw attention
to specific values or sections in a chart.

412
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,802
Trend charts in the Fitness app
use this strategy

413
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:51,104
to highlight your recent activity.

414
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:53,540
When choosing a palette,
it's also important to choose

415
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:58,212
visually distinct colors
to improve accessibility and readability.

416
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:01,682
A good rule is to pick colors
that are easy to differentiate by name

417
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,884
and contrast well from each other.

418
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:08,355
So instead of purple for San Francisco
and purpley-pink for Cupertino,

419
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,258
let's use purple and green.

420
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,727
Let's also make sure
they're not just distinct from each other,

421
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,863
but also from the background.

422
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,765
Ensuring that colors have high contrast
both from each other

423
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,435
and the rest of the chart
makes the chart more accessible

424
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:26,507
for people with visual impairments and
is a better overall design for everyone.

425
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,278
Remember to also try making your colors
distinct for people with color blindness.

426
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:35,215
You can check your choices
with color blindness filters.

427
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:39,620
Finally, make sure your chart respects
system settings by designing colors

428
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:42,022
to adapt for both Dark Mode
and Light Mode,

429
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:44,424
as well as Increase Contrast.

430
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,494
All right, let's recap.
What did we do today?

431
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:51,365
Lilian: Well, we designed a chart
for our pancake food truck app.

432
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:55,369
To do so, we chose marks that most
effectively communicate our goal,

433
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,171
and represented them in VoiceOver,

434
00:23:57,204 --> 00:24:01,508
set our axis range and gridlines
to better communicate values at a glance,

435
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:06,180
added descriptions to ease people in
with context and overviews,

436
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:09,850
incorporated interaction
to offer details on demand,

437
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:13,954
added a splash of color as the butter
on top of our pancake chart,

438
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,924
and further used color to enhance
our second chart

439
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:21,228
for comparing how our pancake sales
between cities stack up.

440
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,863
At every step of the way,

441
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:26,834
we made design decisions to ensure
that our chart was focused,

442
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,570
approachable, and accessible–

443
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:33,607
in other words,
that we made an effective chart.

444
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,475
Halden:
Remember, the chart we designed

445
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:39,179
is part of an entire system of charts
within the rich context of an app.

446
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:42,449
You can use the same design process
to make these other charts on pancakes

447
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,885
flippin' fantastic.

448
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,854
Now I want some pancakes.

449
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:49,256
Lilian: Yeah, me too.

450
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,894
Halden: Thanks for watching.
