Hi, my name is Felipe.

3
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,081
I'm a software engineer on the tvOS team.

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,652
Today I'm excited to share with you
the improvements we've made in tvOS 16

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,623
to make it easier to support
multiple users in your apps.

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:26,460
Apple TV is designed to be used
by everyone.

7
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,899
We've been improving multiple users
on Apple TV since tvOS 13.

8
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,802
In tvOS 16 we have new features
that will make it easier

9
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,872
to support multiple users in all apps.

10
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:43,243
I'll start with an overview of
the multiple users features on Apple TV.

11
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:48,582
Showing how easy it is personalize apps
on a device used by everyone.

12
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,187
Then I'll demonstrate how simple it is
to store the profile selection

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,490
for each user of a streaming app.

14
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,827
Finishing with recommendations
for the best approach for your own app.

15
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:05,799
In tvOS 16 we are making it easier
to have the entire family on Apple TV.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,903
When you press and hold the TV button
on your Siri Remote,

17
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,339
Control Center shows up.

18
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,844
At the top is the list of users
that are on this Apple TV.

19
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,812
New in tvOS 16,

20
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,648
the list of users includes
iCloud Family members

21
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,450
that haven't been added yet,

22
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,654
making it easier than ever
to have the entire family on Apple TV.

23
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,526
Here, Anne isn't on the Apple TV yet.

24
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,863
The plus icon indicates a suggested user.

25
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:40,033
To have Anne join,
we can simply select the suggested user.

26
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:48,542
All Anne needs to do is bring their iPhone
to the same room as the Apple TV,

27
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:52,646
and on the iPhone confirm
the connection.

28
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,348
And that is all.

29
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,485
Anne has now access
to their data on Apple TV.

30
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,756
Now let's go back to Anne's iPhone
for a moment.

31
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,059
Let's take a look at Anne's
favorite video streaming app.

32
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,695
The app is used by the entire family

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,165
and each person has their own profile.

34
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,802
When the app first launches,
it presents a profile picker,

35
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,539
Anne picks her profile.

36
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,475
The app, running on a personal device,

37
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,979
can simply store the preferred profile
in NSUserDefaults,

38
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:30,350
or even put in CloudKit
to have it synced to all devices.

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,888
The iPhone of each member of the family

40
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:38,058
remembers
that person's preferred profile.

41
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,896
There is no need to keep asking
which profile to use when the app opens.

42
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,999
Apple TV is a device shared
by the entire family,

43
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:50,404
and we think it is really important
that everyone who uses Apple TV

44
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,007
is able to access
their own content and data.

45
00:02:54,575 --> 00:03:01,315
In tvOS 14 we introduced the ability
for apps to run as the current user.

46
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,219
With a single checkbox to add
the "Runs as Current User" entitlement,

47
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,454
and no code changes at all,

48
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:12,292
apps can access each user's own data,
just like on iPhone.

49
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:22,102
Your iOS code, calling those APIs,
can run as is on Apple TV,

50
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:27,174
behaving like each person
is using their own personal Apple TV.

51
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,844
When the app launches,
tvOS takes care of everything.

52
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,982
Privacy and security,
all handled by the system.

53
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,752
The "runs as current user" entitlement
is perfect for games

54
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:43,557
and any apps that are all
about individual progress.

55
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,794
Media apps with profiles, though,
need a little bit more.

56
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:52,232
In my example so far,
I skipped an important part: the sign-in.

57
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:58,872
We believe signing in needs to be
as easy and infrequent as possible.

58
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:03,944
In tvOS 15 we introduced a feature
that allows people to use their iPhone

59
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:09,550
or iPad to seamlessly sign in
on your tvOS apps.

60
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,019
It is a first-class sign-in experience,

61
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,154
where the devices work together

62
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,492
to offer the most convenient way
to sign in on Apple TV.

63
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,495
Features not directly available
on Apple TV,

64
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:25,933
like your passwords in iCloud Keychain,
are just a tap away.

65
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,069
To learn how to build
great sign-in experiences,

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:34,741
watch "Simplify sign-in for
your tvOS apps" from WWDC 2021.

67
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,546
And this year
we're introducing support for OAuth

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,049
and passkeys on tvOS.

69
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,152
Passkeys are an awesome
new authentication technology

70
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,722
for replacing passwords
in your apps and websites.

71
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:53,894
To learn more about passkeys,
watch the "Meet Passkeys" video.

72
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,431
But ease and convenience isn't all.

73
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,568
It is still important
to have sign-in happen only once.

74
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:05,506
To achieve this optimal user experience,
with "Runs as Current User,"

75
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,910
we're introducing
a simple new API in tvOS 16.

76
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,913
It is a new constant in Keychain Services

77
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:17,484
that allows apps to access
a user-independent Keychain.

78
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:23,423
Items stored using this new key are always
accessible by all users on Apple TV.

79
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,293
Let's look at an example.

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,163
Here is a method that saves
an item in the Keychain,

81
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,367
with username and password.

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,403
To save the item
to the user-independent Keychain,

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,440
all you have to do is add a new key to the
attributes dictionary

84
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,810
that is passed to the function SecItemAdd.

85
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:49,850
We simply pass true as the value for
the key kSecUseUserIndependentKeychain.

86
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,353
With the user-independent Keychain set,

87
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:58,458
the items you read and write
will be visible to all users.

88
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,528
The combination of both
the new Keychain API

89
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,664
and "Runs as Current User" entitlement

90
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:08,335
allows your apps to have the best
of iPhone and the best of Apple TV:

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,272
simple per-user data separation
on a shared device

92
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:16,677
while maintaining
the single sign-in experience on Apple TV.

93
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,615
In tvOS 16 we've deprecated
the methods to manually map profiles

94
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,618
to system users in TVUserManager.

95
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:29,189
There is no need for you to maintain
a map of users to profiles anymore.

96
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,325
The system will handle it for you.

97
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:36,763
The same APIs you use on iOS can be used,
as is, on Apple TV.

98
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,800
It is so much easier.

99
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,436
Let me show you it all
in action with a demo.

100
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:47,274
I'll walk you through a sample app
that represents media apps with profiles.

101
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,978
This is my streaming video app.

102
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:55,315
Currently it doesn't use any
of the features I talked about.

103
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:00,821
It doesn't run as the current user,
and it doesn't use the new Keychain API.

104
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,124
I'll go ahead and sign in to show you.

105
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,531
After sign-in
I'm presented with a list of profiles.

106
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:14,001
The current user is Mei,
so I'll pick her profile.

107
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,807
Picking a profile shows the personalized
contents Mei wants to see.

108
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:26,680
Later, Anne sits on the couch to watch TV.

109
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,082
They open Control Center

110
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,486
by long pressing the TV button
on the Siri Remote.

111
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,457
Here at the top in Control Center
is the list of users.

112
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:40,627
The green checkmark indicates
the current user.

113
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,897
I'm going to switch to Anne now
and open the app.

114
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:49,269
As expected,
the app presents the profile picker again.

115
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,905
So Anne can select their profile.

116
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,945
But watch what happens
when switching back to Mei.

117
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,651
The app stays in Anne's profile.

118
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:08,856
It doesn't remember that Mei
had picked her preferred profile before.

119
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,525
With the new features in tvOS 16,

120
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,228
the user experience can be much better.

121
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:19,166
I want people using the app to not
have to select again who is watching.

122
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,769
Let's go to Xcode,
and I'll show you how easy it is.

123
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:27,074
Making my app executes
as the current user is simple.

124
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:31,612
All I have to do is add one capability
to my app's target.

125
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,614
Here in my app's target,

126
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,451
I'll go over
to the Signing & Capabilities tab.

127
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,254
Just under the tab, on the top left here,

128
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,757
I'll click the Add Capability button.

129
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,393
It opens the list of capabilities.

130
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,363
The one I'm interested in
is called User Management.

131
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,165
So I'll type "user" to filter the list.

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,437
Now I just double-click the capability
I want to add to my app.

133
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,509
Down here
the "Runs as Current User" checkbox

134
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,512
is selected by default.

135
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,981
That is exactly what I need.

136
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,251
With this entitlement, my app's process
will always be launched

137
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,620
as the currently selected user.

138
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,991
The system will make sure
that the data for each user is distinct.

139
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,961
All of it, including the Keychain.

140
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,298
But for my app,
having a distinct Keychain per user,

141
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,900
would have an unexpected side-effect.

142
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,804
It would require
each user to sign in separately.

143
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:36,610
In tvOS 16 we can maintain the experience
of having a single account for all users

144
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,446
while running as the current user.

145
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:44,885
By using the new Keychain API
to access the user-independent Keychain.

146
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,855
I'll go now to
my KeychainController class,

147
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,158
I use it to read
and write to the Keychain.

148
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:57,231
Here I have the property baseQuery
which has the keys I need

149
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,701
to access the credentials
for my app in the Keychain.

150
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:04,004
To update it to use the new
user-independent Keychain,

151
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,808
all I have to do
is add a new element to the dictionary.

152
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,411
I'll add the new
kSecUseUserIndependentKeychain,

153
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,247
and set it to true.

154
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,553
And that is all I need to change
to make the app share its credentials

155
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,621
with all users.

156
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,256
Nothing else.

157
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,224
It is important to note, though,

158
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:27,361
all other data is still distinct per user.

159
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,930
Like UserDefaults,
which I'm going to use

160
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,966
to remember the profile selection
for each user.

161
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,237
Now let's open my ProfileData class.

162
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,642
This file is shared
between my iOS and tvOS projects.

163
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:46,180
In fact, the iOS version of my app
already stores the profile selection

164
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,282
in UserDefaults,

165
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,484
but only when running on iOS.

166
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:54,555
And that is because
iPhones are personal devices.

167
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,524
But now that my app runs
as the current user,

168
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:00,260
Apple TV can be as personal.

169
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:05,799
I can remove the iOS-check and have
the code work the same way on Apple TV.

170
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:12,005
The system will make sure to use
the correct UserDefaults for each user.

171
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,542
When I run the new version of the app,
it is launched as the current user,

172
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:16,710
which is Mei.

173
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,113
Mei signs in and pick her profile.

174
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:24,251
With the app running as the current user,
it behaves like Apple TV is,

175
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,486
at that moment, a personal device.

176
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,121
Mei's device.

177
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:32,526
Mei's profile selection
gets stored in her UserDefaults.

178
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,561
When it's time for Anne to watch,

179
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:38,232
they switch to their user
using Control Center.

180
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,568
The system will put up
a switching user UI,

181
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,904
while it gives time to your process

182
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:48,442
to finish any last tasks
before it is relaunched.

183
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,979
tvOS now relaunches the app as Anne.

184
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,615
Now Apple TV is Anne's device.

185
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:58,318
The sign-in prompt is skipped,
because the credentials are stored

186
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:02,523
in the user-independent Keychain,
accessible by all users.

187
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,994
But Anne doesn't have a profile selection
stored in their UserDefaults yet,

188
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,062
and the profile picker is shown.

189
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:14,968
Picking Anne's profile,
saves the selection in their UserDefaults.

190
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:19,706
Okay now, at this point Mei and Anne
both have selected their profile.

191
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,141
When switching users,

192
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,511
the app won't show
any interstitial prompts anymore.

193
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,881
It will always go straight to the content,

194
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,451
automatically selecting
the correct profile for each person.

195
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,819
Every time.

196
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,790
That is how, in tvOS 16,
we've made it much easier

197
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,393
to remember each user's profiles.

198
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,664
A simple new API to access
the user-independent Keychain,

199
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:47,968
with the system handling
separating each user's data.

200
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,605
Now that you've seen how to remember
each user's profile selection

201
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:55,075
without requiring everyone
to sign in separately,

202
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,345
let's review how apps work on Apple TV.

203
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,782
Apps without the runs
as current user entitlement

204
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,952
use the resources of the Default User.

205
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:09,623
You can think of it as being
the Apple TV's own resources.

206
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:14,061
Switching users have no influence
on the app's process.

207
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:18,332
Here are my recommendations
for when you do want to personalize.

208
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,201
This table shows
the available capabilities

209
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:25,839
depending on which features
you use on your tvOS apps.

210
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:29,142
If your app is a media app,
or like one,

211
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,212
shows personalized content
through profiles;

212
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:36,717
while having a single account shared
between everyone using the Apple TV,

213
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,553
you adopt
the Runs as Current User entitlement

214
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:44,224
and use the new user-independent
Keychain API.

215
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:48,395
If, like a game,
your app is all about individual progress,

216
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,266
all you have to do is adopt
the Runs as Current User entitlement,

217
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,169
tvOS will handle the rest.

218
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,937
And for all other apps,

219
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,973
apps that present the same content
to all users–

220
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,242
like for example, a recipe app–

221
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,111
you don't have to do anything.

222
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:08,515
Just create a new tvOS app project
in Xcode.

223
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,218
To learn more about
running as the current user,

224
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,922
watch our session from WWDC 2020.

225
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:21,161
We believe a streamlined direct-to-content
experience is the best one for a tvOS app.

226
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,830
I hope all these features help you
implement

227
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,600
great big-screen experiences in your apps.

228
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,269
Thanks for watching,
and enjoy the conference.
