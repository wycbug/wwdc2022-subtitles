Hello. My name is Knott.
I'm from Game Center Engineering.

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,387
Today, I'm going to walk you
through improvements we're making

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,656
in Game Center this year.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,260
Game Center is
Apple's social gaming platform.

6
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:30,931
With Game Center, players set up
a profile and connect with friends.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:36,003
Using GameKit,
you can easily integrate with Game Center.

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,307
Players will be automatically signed in,
can compare scores with their friends

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,512
and other players on leaderboards, and
can track progress through achievements.

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,716
You can also integrate support for
multiplayer matchmaking and realtime play.

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,488
Over the past couple of years,
we've introduced the Access Point,

12
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,425
redesigned the achievements
and leaderboards experiences —

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:04,031
introduced the friends API,
and improved the multiplayer experience.

14
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,168
Additionally, we've been bringing
Game Center activity to more places

15
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,839
across the device including surfacing
what you and friends are playing

16
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,640
in the App Store,

17
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:17,477
and creating new widgets like
Continue Playing and Friends are Playing.

18
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,748
This year,
we're going even further to make

19
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:25,719
the experience better for all players,
provide more exposure

20
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,755
for all of the great things
happening in your games,

21
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:33,961
and give you some new tools
to integrate more easily with Game Center.

22
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,297
I'll walk you through Activity
which brings together

23
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:41,435
all of the Game Center events
from your games into one place.

24
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,672
But before we get to that,
I have an announcement to make.

25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:50,010
We know a lot of game developers
are leveraging Unity

26
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,747
to help build gaming experiences
on Apple platforms.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,884
This year,
we are releasing a Unity plug-in

28
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,220
we've developed specifically for GameKit!

29
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:06,293
The plug-in provides
an entire GameKit API in C#.

30
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,330
So, you don't have to choose
between building your game with Unity,

31
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,902
and taking full advantage of the first
class gaming features in Game Center.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,406
Throughout this session,
you'll see code examples

33
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,210
provided not only in Swift,
but also in C#.

34
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,948
Now, let's dive right into one
of the biggest changes to Game Center

35
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,417
this year: Activity.

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,654
There are so many exciting
things happening in your games

37
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,924
that friends might want to
tell each other about.

38
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:42,029
For example, when they get a
new achievement, or jump up a leaderboard.

39
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:47,067
We've redesigned the Game Center dashboard
this year so that it will now include

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,505
activity from a player's friends in your
game and across games, all in one place.

41
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:57,511
When a player opens the dashboard,
they will see recent activity in your game

42
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:02,583
like achievements earned, when friends
have made huge jumps on the leaderboard,

43
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,353
or when one friend has beaten
another player's high score.

44
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:12,559
And, of course we are designing this
to work on iPad, Mac and Apple TV as well.

45
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,896
I am really excited about what this means
for players to see

46
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,899
and engage more
with what their friends are doing,

47
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,202
and to have your game and all of
the great activity from your game

48
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,137
discovered in more places.

49
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:29,409
If you are already using Game Center for
your games, you don't have to do anything!

50
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:33,046
Your games
will already appear in Activity.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,617
But if not,
it's really easy to get started.

52
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,053
All you need to do is enable
the Game Center capability

53
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:45,392
and write just a few lines of code
to make sure authentication goes smoothly.

54
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,128
First, go to your game's Xcode project,

55
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,798
then head over
to the Signing and Capabilities tab.

56
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:56,837
Click on the add capability button,
then select Game Center.

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,573
Then, go to your app record
in App Store Connect

58
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,676
in order to enable Game Center
for your game.

59
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,847
This is also the place where you
can configure Game Center features,

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,017
such as leaderboards and achievements.

61
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,655
And finally, import GameKit,
then authenticate the local player

62
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,424
by setting the authenticateHandler.

63
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,495
You'll want to place this code
as early as possible in your game,

64
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,564
even on the title screen.

65
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,034
Then, if there is a view controller
available from the callback,

66
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,102
present it here.

67
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:34,074
For Unity developers,
just call "authenticate" on GKLocalPlayer.

68
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:39,046
This static method returns the
local player object once authenticated.

69
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,584
Congratulations! Your game
is now Game Center enabled.

70
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,954
Players will see this welcome banner
when they launch your game,

71
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:52,092
and gameplay activity for your game will
start appearing in the players' feeds.

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:58,332
Now, all that's left is for you to provide
players easy access to the Dashboard.

73
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:02,402
The best way to do so is through
the Game Center Access Point.

74
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:06,273
Access Point provides your players
a convenient way to launch

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,542
the Game Center dashboard.

76
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,713
Let's jump back to some code.
Showing the access point is easy.

77
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:16,717
First, you'll want to decide on
the most appropriate time to display it.

78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,220
You should consider what makes
the most sense for your game,

79
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:24,658
but for many games, the ideal presentation
occurs on the game menu page.

80
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,561
Once you've determined that,
all you need to do

81
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,030
is set a location for its appearance,

82
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:35,235
and then set the GKAccessPoint's
'isActive' property to 'true.'

83
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,573
As a result, the Access Point
will show up in your game.

84
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:43,877
And here is how Unity developers
can use GKAccessPoint in C#.

85
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:48,549
Set the Access Point's location
and set IsActive to true.

86
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,351
When players interact
with the Access Point,

87
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,954
the system brings up the Dashboard.

88
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,091
This provides a familiar place for
players to learn more about your game

89
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,994
as well as check in on recent activity.

90
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,032
Players can explore your game's
own achievements and leaderboards.

91
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:10,470
Next, players will see gameplay events
for your game, featured first in the feed.

92
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,708
Here, Cloeax,
Jeezzzy and I are playing The Coast.

93
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,543
With just those few lines of code,

94
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,713
your game will get increased reach
and distribution

95
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:24,451
while tying in to the broader gaming
experience on Apple platforms.

96
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:29,056
There are a lot of things you can add
in your game that will generate Activity.

97
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,924
Let's start with Leaderboards.

98
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:35,896
Leaderboards are a powerful way to
increase your game's exposure in Activity.

99
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,998
They encourage friendly competition,

100
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,969
giving players more reasons
to jump back into your game.

101
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,371
After you have set up
a leaderboard in your game,

102
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,876
players will see new activity when their
friends are doing well on a leaderboard.

103
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,614
Here, my friend placed
in the top 25% of a leaderboard.

104
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:58,385
Activity also highlights when a player's
friend beats their leaderboard score.

105
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,989
Here, Simundane just beat my score
in a game we've been competing on

106
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,957
back and forth.

107
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,794
For this activity,
players will also get a notification.

108
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,831
This notification is sent from
Game Center,

109
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,900
and you don't need to worry about

110
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,970
asking the user to opt in
to notifications for your game.

111
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,073
If your game
already provides leaderboards,

112
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,544
these activities
will appear automatically.

113
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,680
Even if you're already taking
advantage of leaderboards,

114
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,416
consider expanding your leaderboard sets

115
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,554
to provide more moments of competition
for players and their friends.

116
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:38,158
Recurring leaderboards in particular
provide a sense of timeliness

117
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:42,196
and a reason to re-engage
with your game on an ongoing basis.

118
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,666
Next, I'd like to talk about
how Game Center Achievements

119
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,068
are featured in Activity.

120
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,372
Achievements provide players an
additional way of engaging with your game,

121
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,944
tracking gameplay progress,
and sharing that progress with friends.

122
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,047
When a player completes
an achievement in your game,

123
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,918
this will be reflected in their activity
and their friends' activity as well.

124
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,754
When a player completes
every achievement in your game,

125
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:13,327
we take a moment to recognize that
with a special celebratory activity.

126
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,364
Achievements provide players with
a sense of progress and accomplishment,

127
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:22,369
and can help tell a story of how far
a player has made it through your game.

128
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:27,207
With prominent placement in Activity,
achievements instantly receive

129
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:31,144
wider visibility throughout
the Game Center social network.

130
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,881
Players can see
how their friends are doing,

131
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:38,185
and they'll have more reasons to
jump into your game and play together.

132
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:42,189
You just saw what players will see
when they land on your game's Dashboard.

133
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,558
Players can also visit a friend's profile

134
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,794
to see all of their
recent activity in one place.

135
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,964
And of course, what you see or don't see
on someone's profile

136
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,400
is still based on
the profile privacy option

137
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,636
they choose in Game Center settings.

138
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,506
And that is Activity: a place
where players can discover

139
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,808
their friends' activity in your game,

140
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:05,546
as well as check in
on their friends' activity across games.

141
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,883
In summary, Game Center
is helping you help your players

142
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,720
have more fun playing with
and competing against their friends.

143
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:18,825
Activity is a great destination for
players to check in on their progress

144
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:23,564
as well as their friends' progress
and provide you more distribution.

145
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:28,268
And for Unity developers,
it is now possible to take advantage

146
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:33,106
of the full extent of GameKit
with our brand new Unity plug-in.

147
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,044
You can learn more about how to bring
the best out of Game Center features

148
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,180
from your game,
how to use recurring leaderboards,

149
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,616
and how to use GameKit
in your Unity games

150
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,485
in the sessions linked to this video.

151
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,322
I have covered a lot today.

152
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:53,126
And we trust that this year's updates will
bring more joy to players of your games.

153
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,462
Thank you for watching.

154
