types of SharePlay experiences

for how to make it
a seamless experience

73
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,229
for people using your app.

74
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,566
More people than ever
are relying on FaceTime

75
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,569
and iMessage in order
to stay connected.

76
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,774
With iMessage, we connect by
sharing text or sharing images,

77
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,011
and with FaceTime, we connect
by sharing audio and video.

78
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,882
However, some of the most
meaningful moments

79
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,951
people have together
are about more

80
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,387
than just sharing
a conversation.

81
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:45,292
When we're together, we connect
most by sharing experiences.

82
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,561
So to foster that sense
of closeness,

83
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,663
we built SharePlay,

84
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,632
and by adopting the
Group Activities framework,

85
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,602
you can connect people
in this entirely new way

86
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,505
by allowing them to participate
in SharePlay activities

87
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,874
in your app.

88
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,478
It all comes down
to this concept of activities.

89
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,414
When someone in a FaceTime call
starts an activity,

90
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,484
SharePlay brings the
group directly into your app,

91
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:14,788
where you can create
almost any type of experience.

92
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,491
And an activity can
really be anything;

93
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,827
from cooking together,
to playing piano together.

94
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,563
We've seen a lot of
creative examples of activities

95
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,232
from you already.

96
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,801
And this year,
we focused on elevating

97
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,738
the core SharePlay experience,
making it even easier

98
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,275
for people to share experiences
in your app.

99
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,346
Now, people can start SharePlay
directly from your app.

100
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,115
When someone finds that perfect
piece of content in your app

101
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,284
that they want to share
with their friends,

102
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,487
they can choose who they want
to experience that content with

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,291
and invite them to SharePlay
directly from your app.

104
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,227
This way, people can jump
into a shared experience

105
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,731
with their friends whenever
it feels most natural for them,

106
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,301
without having
to plan in advance.

107
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,038
They'll even get the option to
start SharePlay from Messages,

108
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,374
letting them share an experience
with their friends

109
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,809
without needing to be
on a FaceTime call.

110
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,679
We think people are going
to love all the new ways

111
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,148
they can start SharePlay
from your app.

112
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,517
We'll go over how to adopt
all of these new features

113
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,487
in the session
"What's new in SharePlay."

114
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,122
And that just scratches
the surface

115
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,090
of what SharePlay can do

116
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,060
but we think the real potential
of SharePlay is unlocked

117
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,630
when you unleash your creativity
to build experiences

118
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,533
that bring people
closer together.

119
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,370
And a big part of that is
fostering a sense of presence.

120
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,540
So before we go into how
to build these experiences,

121
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,676
we first have to understand
what it means

122
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,645
to be present with others
and how to take aspects

123
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,514
of a great in-person
experience

124
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,283
and bring them into your apps.

125
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,887
Typically, digital communication
tools are designed to bridge

126
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,157
the gaps in presence,
but in order for SharePlay

127
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,893
to create meaningful moments
between people,

128
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,796
we need to find ways to actually
make people feel present

129
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,800
with each other, as if they were
in the same physical space.

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,202
Now, knowing how to foster
this sense of presence

131
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,105
can be different
for every experience

132
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,507
but one trick we can do
is to think about your app

133
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,143
being used
in the physical world.

134
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,180
So, here's an exercise
we recommend doing:

135
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,583
think of SharePlay like
a portal transporting people

136
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,519
through their phones
and into the same space.

137
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,821
What would they do with your app

138
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,624
if they were actually present
with each other?

139
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,293
If that sounds impossible,
don't worry.

140
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,362
We'll go over some ways
that you can foster

141
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,298
this sense of presence
in your own apps.

142
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,533
Let's do this exercise together.

143
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,702
Imagine you're transported
to a room

144
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,971
with a physical record player.

145
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,174
Everyone can go up to it
and interact with it.

146
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,145
They can put on
their favorite song

147
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,914
and once it's playing,
anyone else in the room

148
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,351
can also go up to the record
player and interact with it.

149
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,253
They can skip forward
in the song

150
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,590
or they can skip
the song entirely.

151
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,358
From this, we found
that we needed

152
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:09,562
to offer shared playback
controls in our app.

153
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,133
And in fact, it's critical that
we don't put any limitations

154
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,735
on who can interact
with these controls.

155
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,704
We want to create
an engaging experience

156
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,006
where everyone feels like
they're able to walk up

157
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,942
and control
that same music player.

158
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,279
OK, now someone has started
playing some music.

159
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,615
The next thing they might
do is look around

160
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,917
and see who's there
listening with them.

161
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,688
Now this may seem obvious,
but that person may be playing

162
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,357
their favorite song for someone
and probably wants

163
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,994
to be reminded of their friend
there listening with them.

164
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,729
When people are doing
these experiences

165
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,998
through their phones,
we need to find ways

166
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,300
to offer reminders
that there are others there

167
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,035
doing that experience
with them.

168
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,140
This exercise is a great way
to start thinking

169
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,676
about the design considerations
that will help

170
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,447
to foster presence in almost
any kind of experience.

171
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,116
Now, I'm going to hand it over
to Priya to talk through

172
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:07,287
some things to keep in mind
when designing your experience.

173
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,389
Priya: Thank you, Ryan.

174
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,891
When designing
an experience for groups,

175
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,828
the first thing to think about
is what shared activities

176
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,596
your app will support.

177
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,366
It might be challenging at first
since many apps

178
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,902
have been designed
with a single person in mind.

179
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,772
Apps have been personalized
to build engaging experiences

180
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,407
for individual people

181
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,342
but a great personalized
experience

182
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,446
might not always translate
to a great group experience.

183
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,249
Here is an opportunity for you
to think of your app

184
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,085
from a different perspective --
to think of an experience

185
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,454
designed specifically
for groups.

186
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,022
When designing your activity,

187
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,959
think about what people like
to do when they're together.

188
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,927
From cooking together
with your friends,

189
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,929
to breathing
through a yoga flow,

190
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,099
watching your favorite team
win the finals

191
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,469
or gasping at every
"Severance" cliffhanger.

192
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,938
All of these are good candidates
for SharePlay

193
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,741
because they're activities that
people love to do together --

194
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,209
in person!

195
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,311
SharePlay provides
the ability to create

196
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,848
rich coordinated experiences
for groups where everyone

197
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,318
has control and shares
the same experience in sync,

198
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,220
to help foster
a sense of presence

199
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,922
when people are apart.

200
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,559
For example, when using
SharePlay with Apple TV+,

201
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,961
pressing play on a video
enables everyone

202
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,363
to watch together.

203
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:27,233
Everyone's playhead is in sync,
and pause, play, seek commands

204
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,868
are all coordinated.

205
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,871
So when Ryan pauses
or Adam resumes,

206
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:36,075
the video pauses and plays
for everyone at the same time.

207
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,511
Apple TV+ is a great example

208
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,214
of a single-view
coordinated experience,

209
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,851
where everyone can watch
and listen to the same thing.

210
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,020
If you're building
a coordinated media experience

211
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,757
like this for your app, you can
add shared playback controls

212
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,426
by adopting
AVPlaybackCoordinator

213
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,563
and using the
coordinateWithSession method.

214
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,098
The system will keep everyone
in perfect sync

215
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,169
as if they were all in the same
room sharing one remote.

216
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,138
But sometimes,
we share activities

217
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,640
that participants
experience differently.

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,477
Some participants
might have different views

219
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,213
of the same coordinated
experience.

220
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,982
For example, when playing
a game of Heads Up!,

221
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,818
one person has to guess
the words on the screen

222
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,155
while their friends shout out
or act out clues.

223
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,823
Now, it wouldn't be
a very difficult game

224
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,226
if the guessers could see
the answers…

225
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,528
so there are two views
in this game,

226
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,931
and not all participants
see the same view.

227
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,068
If you're building a multiview
coordinated experience

228
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,971
like this, you can use
the send method

229
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,641
of the GroupSessionMessenger
class and specify the subsets

230
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,178
of the participants that should
receive the message.

231
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,780
So once you've decided on
the activity you are designing

232
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,883
and the views needed
to support it,

233
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:53,152
the next step is to build a
great experience for the people

234
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
interacting with your app.

235
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,789
Let's discuss some
of the factors

236
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,791
that can make your app's
SharePlay experience

237
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,128
intuitive and easy to use.

238
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,898
In order to build a great
SharePlay experience,

239
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,534
it is important to think
through the different stages

240
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:12,005
of a shared activity --
starting, during, and ending.

241
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,874
We've added the ability
to start a SharePlay session

242
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,510
without the need
for an active FaceTime call.

243
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,713
So people can start a SharePlay
session directly from your app

244
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,583
when they come
across content or an activity

245
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,919
that they want to share
with their friends.

246
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,421
This helps bring everyone
directly to the experience

247
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,691
you've created in your app.

248
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,960
When people browse your app
and come across something

249
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,695
they want to share
with their friends,

250
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,798
they might tap the Share button
to present the Share Sheet.

251
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,701
In order to surface the ability
to SharePlay here,

252
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,971
you can register your app's
group activity by using

253
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,440
the registerGroupActivity(_:)
method.

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,742
People will see the option
to SharePlay the activity

255
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,680
from your app directly
from the Share Sheet.

256
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,049
In order to make
group activities in your app

257
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,918
even more discoverable,
you can support the ability

258
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,521
to SharePlay directly
in your app's UI

259
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,289
with the SharePlay button.

260
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,727
To do this, you can adopt the
GroupActivitySharingContoller.

261
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,730
This allows people to start
a SharePlay session,

262
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,032
select the friends they want
to SharePlay with,

263
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,101
and whether they want
to SharePlay over messages

264
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,536
or FaceTime.

265
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,504
I'm going to go ahead
and SharePlay some music

266
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,007
with Adam and Ryan.

267
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,709
The system will
display information

268
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,979
about the group activity
to them, including the title,

269
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,982
an optional subtitle and image.

270
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,451
It's important that this
information is descriptive

271
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,053
so that Ryan and Adam
know what to expect

272
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,756
when they join
the SharePlay session.

273
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,025
So be sure to implement
the metadata property

274
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,828
for your group activity
with meaningful information

275
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,798
and return a
GroupActivityMetadata instance.

276
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,668
Also consider including
a web-based URL

277
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,270
for participants who might not
have your app installed

278
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,206
on their device already.

279
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,141
This will make it quick
and easy for them

280
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,812
to download your app and join
their friends in the activity.

281
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,314
It's important to remember

282
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,349
that just because someone's
on a Messages group

283
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,550
or FaceTime call

284
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,021
doesn't mean that they have
joined the group activity.

285
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,756
To find out who else
is participating

286
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,090
in the SharePlay session,

287
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,726
people can navigate
to the details view.

288
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,395
Looks like Ryan's
listening with me,

289
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,530
but Adam, who's on
the FaceTime call,

290
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,733
hasn't joined
the SharePlay activity yet.

291
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,503
When possible, you can also
show similar information

292
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,238
in your app's UI.

293
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,639
This is a great way to know

294
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,142
everyone is on
the same page as you.

295
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,779
It also helps maintain a sense
of presence with the group.

296
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,280
If you were all
in the same room,

297
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,515
you would know
how many people

298
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,819
were enjoying the activity
with you just by looking around.

299
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,455
Now we all have some friends
who are always fashionably late

300
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,358
to a party; so, depending on
your app's experience,

301
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,493
you might want to consider
supporting a lobby

302
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,362
where people can wait
for people to join

303
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,431
before beginning
the experience.

304
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,233
For example with Heads Up!,
once everyone has joined

305
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,103
the SharePlay session,
you can tap Let's Play!

306
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,272
to start the game.

307
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,808
OK, so we've covered
how to make starting

308
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,610
and joining a SharePlay
activity seamless.

309
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,747
Now let's consider how to create
an intuitive experience

310
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,749
during an activity.

311
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,985
As part of the ongoing activity,
everyone will be interacting

312
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,488
with your app
at the same time.

313
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,091
We have built a relationship
with our devices

314
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,492
that changes occur
as a result

315
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,728
of us directly
touching something.

316
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,663
But when you build
a shared experience

317
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,698
across different devices,

318
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,168
it's possible that things would
change on someone's screen

319
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,571
due to someone else's
interaction.

320
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,574
So when things change
during a SharePlay session,

321
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,143
it is important to let
everyone know why.

322
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,612
For example,
Ryan might pause the movie

323
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,014
the group is watching
on his device.

324
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,950
When Ryan pauses the video,

325
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,985
it pauses
for everyone else as well,

326
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,988
without any interaction
with their devices.

327
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,891
The system already handles
communicating changes

328
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,461
like these to the rest
of the group with notices

329
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,631
but, for some activities,
people may benefit

330
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,300
from in-app
contextual information

331
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,570
about what's going on
during the activity as well.

332
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,738
For example,

333
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,975
when using SharePlay
with the Flow app by Moleskin,

334
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,345
multiple people might be
drawing on the same page.

335
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,748
When someone draws something,
the app shows the initials

336
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,617
of who drew it,
and this makes for

337
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:22,221
a much more intuitive experience
for the entire group.

338
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,724
It also helps reinforce
the feeling of presence

339
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,359
with the rest of the group.

340
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,628
This is even more important
now that you can SharePlay

341
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,430
over Messages, where you may not
have continuous feedback

342
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,300
from your friends
over audio or video.

343
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,636
All right, so we've started
a SharePlay activity

344
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,804
with our friends.

345
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,006
We've made sure
everyone has joined.

346
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,309
Now, the focus is on
the activity itself.

347
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,379
You might have a fully-immersive
experience that supports

348
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,449
full-screen viewing and might be
hiding the status bar.

349
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,187
For example, the Apple TV app
hides the status bar

350
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,755
and other interface elements

351
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,324
when people are
watching a video

352
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,528
but…  it is important to remember
that the pill in the status bar

353
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,599
gives people access
to important controls.

354
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,768
So, let people redisplay
a hidden status bar

355
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,038
using a simple, discoverable
gesture to give them access

356
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,708
to these types of controls
during the ongoing activity.

357
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,846
In the Apple TV app, a single
tap shows the status bar again

358
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:24,851
and reveals important
experience controls in the UI.

359
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,519
It is also important to remember

360
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,387
that the activity
in your app's interface

361
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,390
is only one part
of the whole experience.

362
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,159
Think about how the people
using your app

363
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,927
will engage with
the rest of the group

364
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,129
during the SharePlay
experience you've built.

365
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,666
Whether they are on a FaceTime
call or texting over Messages,

366
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,535
people are multitasking

367
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,338
so there may be instances
when someone navigates away

368
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,674
from your app
while in a group activity.

369
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,978
For cases like this, remember
to support Picture in Picture

370
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,347
for coordinated
media experiences.

371
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,649
This will allow everyone
to continue watching

372
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,884
with their friends,

373
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,954
maintaining a sense of presence
with the rest of the group.

374
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,123
Whether someone is
responding to a message

375
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,392
or connecting with the group
over FaceTime,

376
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,428
the video doesn't have
to pause every single time.

377
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,131
Considerations like these
when building group activities

378
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,532
for your app
will help make

379
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,402
the end-to-end SharePlay
experience seamless,

380
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,104
breaking down
the digital barriers

381
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,940
to create meaningful moments
where people feel present

382
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,875
with each other.

383
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,078
So make sure to register
your group activity

384
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,782
so people can start to SharePlay
directly from your app;

385
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,452
configure descriptive metadata
so people know what to expect

386
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,288
when they join the activity;

387
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,623
have an experience
for late joiners,

388
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,558
and provide contextual
information

389
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,395
about why the UI
might be changing;

390
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,064
make sure controls
are easy to access;

391
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,601
and support Picture in Picture
for media.

392
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,638
We've talked about a lot today,
so let's do a quick recap.

393
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,675
Now, you can start a SharePlay
session directly from your app

394
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,311
without the need
for an ongoing FaceTime call.

395
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,812
This expands the opportunities

396
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,581
for building a variety
of group activities.

397
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,684
So we recommend
that you do the portal exercise

398
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,253
to start thinking about
how to design an experience

399
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,221
for your app
that helps people feel

400
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,724
like they're in
the same space together;

401
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,360
reimagine your app's
content and activities

402
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,430
to create great experiences
for groups;

403
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,199
and use best practices
when building your experience

404
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,369
to prevent digital barriers
from getting in the way.

405
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,604
We cannot wait to see
the creative uses of SharePlay

406
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,939
that you all come up with.

407
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,641
We hope you enjoyed the session.

408
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,242
Adam and Priya:
