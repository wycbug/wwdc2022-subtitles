Hello, and welcome to "What's
New in App Store Connect."

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,815
My name's Will Averill,
and I'm an engineering manager

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,150
on the App Store Connect team.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,053
App Store Connect has grown
considerably over the years.

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,489
You use it to create,
manage, and grow your apps

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,425
on the App Store
across all of our platforms.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,895
And we continue to bring new
features to App Store Connect

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:33,500
on web, our iOS and iPadOS app,
and the App Store Connect API.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,637
Just last year, we launched
a bunch of great new features.

12
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,273
You've probably heard all about
things like in-app events,

13
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,942
custom product pages,
and TestFlight for Mac.

14
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,744
So instead,
let me quickly highlight

15
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,546
a couple recent updates
you might have missed.

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,916
In TestFlight, we made
managing your build's

17
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,518
associated tester groups easier.

18
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,721
With just one click, you can
now quickly add or remove

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,290
a tester group to a build

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,493
directly from the Versions
or Build Groups tab.

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,162
We also heard your feedback
loud and clear,

22
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,798
so we made an update
allowing you to transfer apps

23
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,867
that use Apple Wallet.

24
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,603
And finally, to facilitate
the submission process

25
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,972
for in-app events,
custom product pages,

26
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,840
and product page optimization,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,044
we launched the enhanced
App Store submission experience.

28
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,179
This is one the biggest
enhancements we've made

29
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,714
to the submission workflow,

30
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,184
so let's explore this together
in a bit more detail.

31
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,054
First, you're now able
to group multiple items

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,323
into a single submission.

33
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,224
Additionally --
in most cases --

34
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,861
you can choose to submit
without a new app version.

35
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,864
And we introduced
a dedicated App Review page

36
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,999
where you can manage
in-progress submissions,

37
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,535
communicate with App Review,

38
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,471
and even view recently
completed submissions.

39
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,440
Let's start by talking
about what it means

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,242
to group items
in a review submission.

41
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,478
Say we have a number
of custom product pages

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,781
or any other review items
we want to publish to the store.

43
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,650
Since review items
can only be submitted

44
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,518
as part of a review submission,

45
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,154
the first step is
to add them to one.

46
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,290
Think of a review submission
as the vehicle

47
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,893
that carries review items
to and from App Review.

48
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,397
Now, a review submission only
needs one item to be submitted,

49
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,399
but the advantage
to grouping several items

50
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,868
is they are all reviewed
in context together.

51
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,871
This helps ensure a consistent
and efficient review.

52
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,806
In fact, all review submissions

53
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,209
are typically reviewed
within 24 hours,

54
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,113
regardless of the number
or type of review items.

55
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,048
After review,
each item in the submission

56
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,784
will be marked as
accepted or rejected.

57
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,052
It's very important
to understand

58
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,321
that no review
items are approved

59
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,591
until all items in the review
submission are accepted.

60
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,493
So let's look at two ways
to move forward

61
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,529
with a review submission
that has rejected items.

62
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,832
The first option is to edit any
of these rejected review items

63
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,534
and then resubmit.

64
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,936
If those items
now come back accepted,

65
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,671
the review submission
is complete

66
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,839
and every item is approved

67
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,675
and able to be published
to the App Store.

68
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,210
The other option
is to simply remove

69
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,913
any rejected items
from the submission.

70
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,515
This leaves
the review submission

71
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,083
with only approved items,

72
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,119
once again completing
the review process.

73
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,789
However, keep in mind
that any removed items

74
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,992
will need to be resubmitted
as a part of a new submission

75
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,227
in order to become approved.

76
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,495
And before I move on,

77
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,431
let me specify that
review submission items

78
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,133
can be app versions,
in-app events,

79
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,438
custom product pages, or
product page optimization tests.

80
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,773
Now, let's take a look
at how you're able to submit

81
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,742
without a new app version.

82
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,944
To understand how this works,

83
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,379
let's discuss
a few more specifics

84
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,714
about review submissions.

85
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,486
First, each submission
has an associated platform.

86
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,455
In addition,
each platform supports

87
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,024
a specific set of review items.

88
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,526
Although, as you can see,
most items are reviewed

89
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,930
and grouped as part
of an iOS submission.

90
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,933
And lastly, you can have one
in-progress review submission

91
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,367
per platform.

92
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,503
In this example,
you can see we're working

93
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,272
towards submitting all three
versions of our app.

94
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,341
But, let's go ahead
and take a closer look

95
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,177
at the iOS review submission.

96
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,780
App Review reviews
all items in a submission

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,650
against an app version to ensure
everything is consistent.

98
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,752
If there's an app version
in the submission,

99
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,088
that becomes the version
used for review.

100
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,590
But like I mentioned earlier,

101
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,427
you can submit without adding a
new version to your submission.

102
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,929
To do this requires
a previously approved version

103
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,030
of your app.

104
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,565
Of course,
once submitted,

105
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,835
items will be reviewed
against this version.

106
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,171
This means you're able
to submit in-app events,

107
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,541
custom product pages and
product page optimization tests

108
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,511
anytime after your first
iOS version is approved,

109
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,447
without needing
a new app binary.

110
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,016
So now that I've explained
how this experience works,

111
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,317
let me show you
where the dedicated

112
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,821
App Review submission page
lives in App Store Connect.

113
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,856
Once you've logged in
and selected an app,

114
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,326
click the App Review link
on the left nav menu.

115
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,629
This is the App Review page

116
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,532
where you can manage
your entire review workflow.

117
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,734
Here, you can see an overview
of your submissions

118
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,171
and click into any of them
for a more detailed look.

119
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,873
Now obviously,
using the web UI is great,

120
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,775
but wouldn't it be nice
to submit and track

121
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,378
submission status on the go?

122
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,746
That's why we're excited
to share

123
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,915
that we've brought the
enhanced submission experience

124
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:20,520
to App Store Connect on iPadOS
and iOS with this week's update.

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,888
You'll now be able to submit

126
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,457
any of your Ready for Review
submissions to App Review

127
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,327
from anywhere,
with just one tap.

128
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,628
Once submitted,

129
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,965
you can track the progress
of your review submissions.

130
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,868
And you can opt in
to receive timely notifications

131
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,370
about status updates

132
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,608
as well as manage your
submission by removing items,

133
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:46,213
viewing rejection reasons,
and replying to App Review.

134
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,949
So that's the enhanced
App Store submission experience,

135
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,951
available now
on App Store Connect

136
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,853
for iPadOS and iOS.

137
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,388
Let's shift gears a bit
and focus on

138
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,224
the App Store Connect API

139
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,559
which represents a great way
for you to customize

140
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,928
and automate your app workflows.

141
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,664
Best of all, we're always
working to add new capabilities

142
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,633
to the API.

143
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:10,370
Last year, we added support
for App Clips, Xcode Cloud,

144
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,772
in-app events,
custom product pages,

145
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,641
product page optimization,

146
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,043
and even the enhanced App Store
submission experience

147
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,511
I just described.

148
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,413
And this year is no different.

149
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,283
With our huge 2.0 release
coming this summer,

150
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,685
we're expanding the number
of resources in the API

151
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,721
by 60 percent.

152
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,955
In this summer's release,

153
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,790
we're adding some
great new functionality

154
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,859
that has been heavily requested.

155
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,562
Beginning with
a comprehensive set of APIs

156
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,664
to manage your entire
in-app purchase

157
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,933
and subscription lifecycle.

158
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,935
We started by breaking
subscriptions

159
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,770
into their own resource

160
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,607
and giving you full control
to create, edit, or delete

161
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,710
any of your in-app purchases
or subscriptions.

162
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,881
You'll also be able to manage
pricing, submit for review,

163
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,851
and create special offers
and promo codes.

164
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,653
We can't wait to see
how you take advantage

165
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,122
of this new opportunity
to automate your in-app purchase

166
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,491
and subscription workflows.

167
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,759
We're also adding the ability

168
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,862
to fetch and respond
to your app's customer reviews.

169
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,697
The goal here
is to allow you to build

170
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,267
some great custom workflows
around customer interaction.

171
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,536
And lastly, we're adding
additional reporting data

172
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,439
to the power and performance
metrics and diagnostics APIs

173
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,141
for app hangs.

174
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,576
Identifying and eliminating
hangs in your app

175
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,612
is a great way
to increase performance

176
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,014
and improve user experience.

177
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,317
But until now,
you could only view metrics

178
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,186
like your app's hang rate
through the API.

179
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,988
That changes this summer
as we're adding

180
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,325
a new diagnostic type
for app hangs.

181
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,626
You'll be able use this type

182
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,362
with the existing
diagnostic signatures resource

183
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,863
to discover the places
in your app

184
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,032
that contribute most to hangs.

185
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,001
Not only that,
but you'll also be able to see

186
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,470
detailed stack traces
for these hang signatures

187
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,707
through the diagnostic logs
relationship.

188
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,842
I've just barely scratched
the surface here,

189
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,178
so if you'd like to learn more
about how these APIs work

190
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,914
or how to use this data
to discover additional insights

191
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,282
into your app's behavior,

192
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,085
definitely check out
these two related sessions.

193
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,722
Overall, the App Store Connect
API 2.0 release

194
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,757
represents a major milestone.

195
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,361
After four years of development,
we've fully embraced REST APIs

196
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,097
as the future of
App Store Connect automation.

197
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,432
As a result,
we'll begin to decommission

198
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,735
the XML feed this fall.

199
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:25,171
Therefore, we highly encourage
you to align your integration

200
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,007
with the App Store Connect API
moving forward.

201
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,443
In summary, we recommend
taking full advantage

202
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,512
of the enhanced App Store
submission experience

203
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,615
in order streamline
your review process.

204
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,184
Also, be sure to download
the latest release

205
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,221
of App Store Connect
for iOS and iPadOS,

206
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,857
which adds support for the
enhanced submission experience

207
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,393
and several other updates.

208
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,162
And finally, we're adding
a bunch of new capabilities

209
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,730
to the App Store Connect API

210
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,400
with the 2.0 release
this summer.

211
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,503
We strongly suggest working
to integrate with our API,

212
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,305
especially as we begin
to decommission the XML feed

213
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,040
later this fall.

214
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,209
As always, we look forward
to hearing your feedback

215
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,379
and hope you have a great WWDC!

216
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,881
Thanks for watching.
