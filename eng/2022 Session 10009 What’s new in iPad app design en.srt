Hi, welcome to
our session on iPad App design.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,946
I'm Bryant Jow.

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,147
And I'm Grant Paul,

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,250
and we're from
the Apple Design Team.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,318
Bryant: Today, we'll show you
some of the new UIKit

8
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,520
and SwiftUI updates
in iPadOS 16,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,655
as well as some general tips

10
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,958
for incorporating these
into your app designs.

11
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,426
With iPadOS 16,

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,862
people can take advantage
of larger resolutions

13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,832
with extended display support
and display zoom

14
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,367
and work with their apps
in a single view

15
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,569
by using Stage Manager.

16
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,372
So what does this mean
for iPad apps?

17
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,674
Your app design should always
embrace larger screens

18
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,075
and different window sizes,

19
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,545
as well as support all
the different inputs of iPadOS.

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,614
And now, your iPad apps
should consider

21
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,283
how to lean into
more advanced use cases

22
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,319
that come with using iPad
like a desktop.

23
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,788
So that's why we're introducing
a number of improvements

24
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,358
to help apps become
more powerful and easier to use.

25
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,528
Here's a preview
of the features we'll cover:

26
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,064
toolbars and customization,

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,700
document menu,

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,635
editing menus,

29
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,604
find and replace,

30
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,239
navigation,

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,807
search,

32
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,542
tables,

33
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,878
and selection.

34
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,446
Today, we're going
to show examples

35
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,281
of how you can
incorporate these updates

36
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,251
in designing two kinds
of experiences:

37
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,055
document editing
and content browsing.

38
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,957
We'll start with
document editing

39
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,725
and look at how these
improvements can help people

40
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,361
be more productive
when using your app.

41
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,330
Let's jump into toolbars.

42
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,999
Toolbars are a really important
component in app design

43
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,168
because they organize
your app's functionality,

44
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,469
and this impacts how easy it is

45
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,038
for people to go about
their workflows.

46
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:49,309
Here's the previous toolbar
in the Pages app in iPadOS 15.

47
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,646
In iPadOS 16, we're introducing
a new toolbar layout

48
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,681
that aligns titles
to the left side

49
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,018
and allows apps to offer more
toolbar items in the center.

50
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,554
Let's take a closer look.

51
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,756
Here's the leading section
of the toolbar.

52
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,292
It should contain items
that help people navigate within

53
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,693
and outside of the document,

54
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,962
like the back and sidebar
buttons.

55
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,231
And it displays the new
document title and menu,

56
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,600
which I'll come back to later.

57
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,302
With more space in the toolbar,

58
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,305
apps can elevate commonly used
actions in the center.

59
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,673
In iPadOS 16,

60
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,709
the Pages app shows actions
for inserting content.

61
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,377
You should consider

62
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,412
what are the most common
workflows in your app

63
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,848
where people could benefit
from one-tap access.

64
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,117
But be careful not
to pack your app's toolbar

65
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,918
with too many items.

66
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,720
Let's look at a couple more
tools to consider

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,223
if your app
has a lot of functionality.

68
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,826
In iPadOS 16, you can
enable customizable toolbars

69
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,028
so people can curate the items

70
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,230
that are most important
for their workflow.

71
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,032
If your app has
a lot of toolbar items

72
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,534
or advanced features
that not all people need,

73
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,103
you should consider
enabling customization.

74
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,838
Note how items
in the center section

75
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,342
can be added, removed,
or rearranged.

76
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,944
Items outside of this section
are not customizable

77
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,147
because these may include
navigation buttons

78
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:04,985
or important features that need
to be always accessible.

79
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,188
Toolbar items can also be
grouped or collapsed.

80
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,223
Use groups
to keep related actions together

81
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,026
in the toolbar
or the overflow menu.

82
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,728
In the Pages app,
similar actions

83
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,598
like inserting tables, charts,
shapes, and photos

84
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,734
are grouped together.

85
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,869
When there's not enough room
in the toolbar,

86
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,238
these actions collapse
into a plus button.

87
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,706
You can also
make wide toolbar items

88
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,877
collapse into a compact glyph
at smaller window sizes.

89
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,816
Now, let's take a look at the
trailing section of the toolbar.

90
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,385
This section may contain
a variety of items:

91
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,987
any button that invokes
nearby inspectors,

92
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,990
important items that should stay
visible at any window size,

93
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,792
and an optional overflow button

94
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,527
for people to access
hidden items

95
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,497
as well as toolbar
customization.

96
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,532
When people resize your app,

97
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,068
the toolbar items in the center
will automatically hide

98
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,737
into an overflow menu
when there's not enough room.

99
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,840
And when the window
is resized even smaller,

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,076
only the leading and trailing
sections remain.

101
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,945
So make sure to arrange
important items

102
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,314
in the trailing section
if you want them to be visible

103
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,916
at most window sizes.

104
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,119
So here's a quick recap
of toolbars.

105
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,587
Consider if there are
common workflows

106
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,289
that you can elevate
in the toolbar.

107
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,025
Arrange important toolbar items
in the trailing section

108
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,295
to avoid overflow
in smaller window sizes.

109
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,265
Enable customization if your app
has many toolbar items

110
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,234
and advanced use cases.

111
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,002
And wherever possible,

112
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,772
try to organize similar items
into groups.

113
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,641
Now let's take a look
at the new document menu

114
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,376
that we mentioned earlier.

115
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,279
To make it easier for people
to find document-related actions

116
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,214
in one place across apps,

117
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,451
we're introducing a new title
and menu in the toolbar.

118
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,554
This layout is intended for
document viewers like Quick Look

119
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,323
or document-editing apps
like Keynote.

120
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,659
Note, these apps may also
have a browser view,

121
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,060
which can appear
as a back button

122
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,962
near the document title.

123
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,330
If your app is primarily used

124
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,633
for editing or viewing
documents,

125
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,801
you should consider
using this new menu.

126
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,637
Let's open Keynote's
document menu

127
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,372
by clicking the title.

128
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,474
Here, you can see
there is a combined set

129
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,845
of standard document actions
as well as app-specific ones.

130
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,947
So, what should go inside here?

131
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,749
The menu should contain actions

132
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,085
that affect the document
as a whole.

133
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,254
Here are some examples
of standard actions

134
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,490
that should go inside
the document menu:

135
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,528
Duplicate, Rename, Move,
Export, and Print.

136
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,565
You can also add custom actions
for your app.

137
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,701
But not everything should go
inside in the document menu.

138
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,170
Actions that take content
outside of your app

139
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,972
should be placed under Share,

140
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,509
and actions that directly affect
content inside a document

141
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,444
should support
toolbar customization

142
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,682
and appear in edit menus
where appropriate.

143
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,084
Next, I want to talk about
a couple of features

144
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,187
that can help users work more
efficiently in your iPad app.

145
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,723
Let's look at edit menus.

146
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,858
These menus may appear
over selected text

147
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,861
and contain edit options
such as Copy and Paste.

148
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,131
In iPadOS 16,
edit menus have a new look

149
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,301
and are optimized
for touch and pointer.

150
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,037
When using touch,
the menu appears horizontally

151
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,006
and people can now scroll
back and forth

152
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,276
between the list of options
like this.

153
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,178
When using pointer,
the edit menu

154
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,146
shows a more comprehensive
list of options

155
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,182
in a vertical layout like this.

156
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,683
Your app should support
both styles

157
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,053
for touch and pointer
interactions.

158
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,156
When you incorporate
these edit menus into your app,

159
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,326
here are a couple of things
to remember.

160
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,128
Don't remove
the standard actions

161
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,097
like Cut, Copy, and Paste.

162
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,799
These editing tools are
important to many workflows

163
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,068
and should be always available.

164
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,937
And you should organize
custom actions

165
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,406
close to related system actions.

166
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,509
In iPadOS 16, the Notes app
groups formatting options

167
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,546
for checklists and text
in the same section.

168
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,383
Edit menus are not just limited
to text fields.

169
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,419
They can also apply to objects
on a document canvas.

170
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,491
Here's an example of selecting
layers in Keynote with touch.

171
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,627
And that same menu
when using pointer.

172
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,630
Try to integrate these menus
into any editable content

173
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,068
so that people can be more
productive when using your app.

174
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,603
So that's edit menus.

175
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,040
Now, let's dive into
find and replace.

176
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,742
In iPadOS 16, we're introducing
find and replace

177
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,211
into the system keyboard
so people can quickly search

178
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:30,216
for specific words, phrases,
and more within a document.

179
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,085
This also supports
advanced use cases

180
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,587
like matching specific parts
of a phrase

181
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,091
or replacing all matches
with a different word.

182
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,827
And when iPad is attached
to a hardware keyboard,

183
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,096
the find and replace interface
sits above the app

184
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,833
in this compact appearance.

185
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,069
To make find and replace
easy to access,

186
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,771
consider adding an item
inside the overflow menu

187
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,141
as well as the system keyboard
shortcuts.

188
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,543
So those are some
of the new features

189
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,878
we're introducing
for document editing.

190
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,513
Now I'm going to hand it off
to Grant Paul,

191
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,549
who will talk about
some more improvements.

192
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,185
Grant: Thanks, Bryant.
Next up, I'm going to talk about

193
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,554
improvements
for content browsing,

194
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:11,024
something that you do
in a lot of different iPad apps.

195
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,427
Content browsing experiences
are everywhere on iPad,

196
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,230
whether you're managing
in your photo library in Photos,

197
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,900
browsing Apple Music,
or choosing a document in Pages.

198
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,636
iPadOS 16 has
some great new features

199
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,606
and patterns
for content browsing.

200
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,975
I'm going to focus
on three areas

201
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,778
that are important
to this part of an app.

202
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:36,182
The first one is some updates
to app navigation.

203
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,819
iPadOS 16 has
a new style of navigation

204
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,256
that we call "browser-style"
navigation.

205
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:47,527
For example, the Files app
uses back and forward buttons

206
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,729
to let you easily
browse between folders

207
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,967
that might have come from
different places in the sidebar.

208
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,169
With browser-style navigation,

209
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,838
it's up to your app
to choose the buttons

210
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,941
that go to the left
of the title.

211
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,545
You should make sure to keep to
just those navigational buttons

212
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,883
like back and forward,
or maybe a sidebar button.

213
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,419
Browser-style navigation
works well

214
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,622
when your app
has a complex hierarchy

215
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,025
where people are often jumping
between different levels;

216
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,096
things like a file browser
or a web browser.

217
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:27,534
If your app has a shallow
or flat hierarchy, like Photos,

218
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,370
you might not need
browser-style navigation

219
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,340
because all of the destinations
in the app are already available

220
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,011
with a single tap
in the sidebar.

221
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,181
If you do use browser-style
navigation,

222
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:45,285
it goes great with another
new feature in iPadOS 16:

223
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:50,390
putting search in the top right
of the navigation bar.

224
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,893
Search in the top right
is great when your search bar

225
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,363
is used to filter the content
that you're looking at below

226
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,599
on the same screen.

227
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,235
And even though
it's in the navigation bar,

228
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,571
it supports suggestions.

229
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:09,642
Suggestions show up right off
the field as you're typing.

230
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,512
Your app can suggest
recent searches.

231
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,647
It can also suggest
recommendations

232
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,516
for what to search for.

233
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:21,354
And it can suggest filters
to narrow down your search.

234
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,324
Again, search in the top right
is meant for searching

235
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,393
the content
that's showing below.

236
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,096
If you want to search
your entire app at once,

237
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,432
it's better to keep that
in a search tab

238
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,400
so that people can get to search

239
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,671
from wherever they are
in your app.

240
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,007
That's what's new
for navigation.

241
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,078
Next up, I want to talk about
selection and menus.

242
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,681
iPadOS 15 introduced
band selection,

243
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:54,254
using the pointer to quickly
select multiple notes at once.

244
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,857
But you still have to use the
toolbar to act on the selection

245
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,728
and to leave edit mode
when you're done.

246
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:05,532
iPadOS 16 makes that
much easier.

247
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,233
If you use band selection,

248
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:12,005
iPadOS no longer enters
editing mode automatically.

249
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,173
You can now use
keyboard modifiers

250
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,011
like Command and Shift
to select and deselect,

251
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,180
also without going into
editing mode.

252
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,683
And once you have
the notes selected,

253
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:29,956
it's just a secondary click
to act on all of them together.

254
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,893
With touch, you can long press
to get a context menu

255
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,663
for those same actions.

256
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:42,135
And these interactions
work just as well with a list.

257
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,371
You can hold Command
to select multiple notes,

258
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,174
use drag-and-drop
to move them into a folder,

259
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,842
and bring up a context menu

260
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,246
to act on multiple notes
together.

261
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,149
Along with these
multi-item context menus,

262
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,287
iPadOS 16 also supports
context menus in empty areas,

263
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,257
which you can use
to create something new.

264
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:08,428
For example, you can make
a new folder in Files.

265
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:15,001
Or, you can paste
a copied event in Calendar.

266
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,805
OK. That's a lot of things
to keep in mind for selection.

267
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,741
Let's go through the checklist.

268
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
Your app should support
keyboard focus

269
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,948
to navigate around using
the arrow keys and with tab.

270
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,018
Support band selection
to quickly select

271
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:36,022
multiple items in a grid
by using the pointer.

272
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:40,026
Allow multiple selection
without entering editing mode

273
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,396
when using the pointer
or the keyboard.

274
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,765
Add context menus to act

275
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,435
on multiple selected items
together.

276
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,070
And in the empty area,

277
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,841
use a context menu
to create new items.

278
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,678
The next thing I want
to talk about is submenus.

279
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,215
On iPhone,
submenus open vertically.

280
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,485
Since space is limited
and they're an extra tap away,

281
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,720
it's best to use submenus
on iPhone

282
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,024
only when you really need one.

283
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,860
But on iPadOS 16,

284
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,764
submenus open horizontally
when they have space available.

285
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:22,402
This makes them much faster,
especially with a pointer.

286
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,571
For example,
Calendar uses a submenu

287
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,209
to really quickly move an event
into a different calendar.

288
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,213
And Reminders uses submenus
to quickly change the due date

289
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,783
and the priority.

290
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,985
So on iPad,
you should consider

291
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,555
including submenus
in your app's context menus

292
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,693
to make quick changes
just like these.

293
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:51,531
Along with submenus, iPadOS 16
also adds a new control

294
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,434
for pop-up buttons in lists.

295
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,070
Just like any other
pop-up button,

296
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,039
these show a menu
to let you choose an option.

297
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,775
Let's look at these in practice.

298
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,545
In the past,
editing a reminder's priority

299
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,980
meant pushing
into the detail view,

300
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,016
then popping back out.

301
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:15,088
It's a bunch of taps, and it
also took you out of context.

302
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,892
In iPadOS 16, you change
the priority right in place.

303
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,863
It's much faster, and you stay
right where you are.

304
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,231
So as you've seen here,

305
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,101
the main use for these
pop-up buttons in lists

306
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:34,207
is to replace navigation pushes
in popovers and in modals.

307
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,342
When you're using
a pop-up button,

308
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,477
choose places where you have

309
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,880
a well-defined set of options
to pick from.

310
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,683
Make sure to only
use a pop-up button

311
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,887
if your options really do
fit nicely into a menu.

312
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,390
If your option is better
as a switch, use a switch.

313
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,793
And if the options
really need more controls,

314
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,162
don't try and force it.

315
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,898
But if you only sometimes
need more controls,

316
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,402
a good choice can be to add
a Custom option into the menu.

317
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,471
When someone chooses Custom,

318
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,940
your app can reveal
the extra controls

319
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,345
without getting in the way
of the other choices.

320
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,947
And if your options
need an explanation,

321
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,452
you can put that underneath
the pop-up button in the list.

322
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,688
All right. That's what's new
for selection and menus.

323
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,625
Lastly, I want to talk about
tables.

324
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,295
Tables are a great new component
in iPadOS 16

325
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,598
to make your lists of content
more powerful.

326
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,435
Now, in the past, you may have
used a control called a table.

327
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,070
But that wasn't quite right;

328
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,074
it's not much of a table
if it only has a single column.

329
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,378
iPadOS 16 has a real table.

330
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,682
Tables in SwiftUI show
multiple columns of information.

331
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,886
And they let you sort
just by tapping a header.

332
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,156
Now, since iPad screens
are relatively small,

333
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:01,294
you'll only be able to show
the most important columns.

334
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,162
But you can swap
those columns out,

335
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,331
like replacing Size with Kind,

336
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,135
just by choosing
a different sort option.

337
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,204
And as makes sense
for something that's all about

338
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,273
having powerful access
to your content,

339
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,577
sortable tables also support
all of the selection features

340
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:21,347
I talked about earlier.

341
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,550
So tables are
a really powerful control,

342
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,386
but it's important
to use them correctly.

343
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,923
These tables built into iOS 16
are built to show

344
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,594
more information
about a list of content,

345
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,230
not to show
a spreadsheet of data.

346
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,498
You can think of them
as an extended version

347
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,502
of the list views that you
already have in your app.

348
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,640
In fact, when you resize an app
to a compact width,

349
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,845
tables will switch back
into being single-column lists.

350
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,114
And when they do,
we recommend

351
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,817
taking those details
from the secondary columns

352
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,752
and moving that information

353
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,522
into a secondary line of text
within each row

354
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,727
so all of that information
is still available.

355
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,663
And for sorting,
you can use a toolbar button

356
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,699
to quickly reveal
the sort options.

357
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,870
So those are the new components
and features in iPadOS 16.

358
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,171
Let's go back to Bryant

359
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,375
to recap everything
we talked about today.

360
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,676
Bryant: Thanks, Grant.

361
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,111
A lot of the features
we covered today

362
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:29,215
are aimed around helping users
be more productive with iPad.

363
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,684
As you think about how
these relate to your iPad app,

364
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,186
consider how you can
make your app more powerful

365
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,023
by offering more functionality,
better organization,

366
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,060
and make common editing and
browsing tasks more efficient.

367
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,529
Evaluate your app design
in resizable windows

368
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,431
and larger screens.

369
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,233
And ensure your app
works seamlessly

370
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,468
with touch and pointer.

371
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,270
Grant: And if you want
an overview

372
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,407
of what goes into designing
a great iPad app,

373
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,109
you should make sure
to check out our previous talk,

374
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,145
"Designed for iPad."

375
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,847
Bryant: Thanks for watching.
