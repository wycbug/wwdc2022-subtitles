Hi, my name
is Karen Xing.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,414
I'm an engineer
in the Camera Software team.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,750
Welcome to
"Bring Continuity Camera support

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,186
to your macOS app"

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,688
To start this session
I will talk about,

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,124
what is Continuity Camera?

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,760
Next, I will discuss
how your application

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,529
can build an automatic
camera selection experience

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,165
with Continuity Camera.

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,935
And finally,
I will walk through the APIs

13
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:40,474
that are new in macOS 13
for Continuity Camera.

14
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,109
With Continuity Camera,

15
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,279
you can now use iPhone
as your webcam.

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,680
Setup is seamless;

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,116
just bring your iPhone
close to your Mac.

18
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:54,621
And it works wirelessly
so you can quickly join a call.

19
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,190
Your iPhone
will appear on your Mac

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,927
as an external camera
and microphone

21
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,962
under several conditions.

22
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:07,334
First, you must be running
macOS 13 and iOS 16.

23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,971
Both Mac and iPhone must be
signed into the same Apple ID

24
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,941
using two-factor authentication.

25
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,642
For wired connection,

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:20,113
the phone needs to be
connected to Mac over USB.

27
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,382
Or for wireless connection,

28
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,952
the two devices need to be
in proximity

29
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,622
and have both Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi turned on.

30
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,625
Rather than talking through it,
let me show you right away

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,595
how magical Continuity Camera
looks on devices.

32
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,765
Here I have a MacBook Pro
and iPhone 13 Pro.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,569
Both devices are signed in
to the same Apple ID.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,444
The phone is placed on a stand
attached to my MacBook.

35
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,679
I will be joining
a video conferencing call

36
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,381
with my colleague Eric today

37
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,919
and show you how we can use
Continuity Camera in Zoom.

38
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,094
The app is launched using
the built-in camera first,

39
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,830
and then an onboarding dialogue
shows up

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,866
describing what you can do
with the new camera.

41
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,835
The dialogue shows up one time

42
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,105
after your Mac is upgraded
to macOS 13

43
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,841
when you open a camera
application for the first time

44
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:25,879
and there's an iPhone eligible
for Continuity Camera.

45
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,283
Hi, Eric!

46
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:35,155
Eric: Oh, Karen! Hi!

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,258
Karen: After the onboarding
dialogue is shown on the system,

48
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,927
Continuity Camera
and microphone devices

49
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:45,532
will become available
in all applications.

50
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,542
Let's switch to use this camera
and see how it looks.

51
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:05,318
Continuity Camera uses the rear
camera system on the iPhone,

52
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,354
so you get the same
great video quality

53
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,122
that you expect from iPhone.

54
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,060
And it works with all four
orientations of the phone.

55
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,733
The portrait orientation
gives you a more zoomed in

56
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,637
field of view compared
to landscape orientation.

57
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,477
Continuity Camera
also lets you do things

58
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,647
that were never before
possible with a webcam,

59
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,184
including several new
video effects.

60
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,985
You're probably already familiar

61
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,354
with Center Stage
and Portrait video effects

62
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,992
introduced in iOS 14.5
and macOS 12.3.

63
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,462
If not, I highly recommend
watching the

64
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:53,333
"What's new in Camera Capture"
session from WWDC 2021

65
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,635
to learn more about
system video effects

66
00:03:55,635 --> 00:04:00,307
and how to interact with them
in applications.

67
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,710
Let's go to Control Center
and enable system video effects

68
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,379
on Continuity Camera.

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:15,255
Center Stage keeps you in frame
as you move around in the scene.

70
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,359
Portrait blurs the background

71
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,195
and naturally
puts the focus on you.

72
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,365
Portrait is only supported
on Apple silicon Macs,

73
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,100
but with Continuity Camera,

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,072
it is now available on all
Intel and Apple silicon Macs.

75
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,378
Studio Light
is a new system video effect

76
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,547
available on macOS 13.

77
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,782
It is supported
by Continuity Camera

78
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,218
when using iPhone 12 or newer.

79
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,588
Enable this when you want
to look your best on screen.

80
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,957
It provides a stunning
lighting effect

81
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,794
that dims the background
and illuminates your face.

82
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,131
Studio Light is perfect
for tough lighting situations,

83
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,967
like when you're
in front of a window.

84
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,970
Even though I'm showing you
each video effect separately

85
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,475
for a clear comparison,
all of them work well together.

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,515
And any combination
of the effects

87
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,119
can be applied at the same time.

88
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,328
Here's another exciting feature
I really want to show you

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,630
for Continuity Camera.

90
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,034
When you want to work together
and share what's on your desk,

91
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,102
you can now use Desk View.

92
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,972
The Desk View app
comes with macOS 13

93
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,776
and can be launched right here
in Control Center.

94
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,051
It works like an overhead
camera setup,

95
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,054
without needing
all the complicated equipment.

96
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,257
iPhone will split the Ultra Wide
camera feed in two,

97
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,560
showing off your desk and face
both at the same time,

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,963
so you can collaborate
on a school project

99
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,398
or teach a friend
a knitting stitch.

100
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,134
It leverages the extended
vertical field of view

101
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,737
of our Ultra Wide angle
camera,

102
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,374
applies perspective distortion
correction onto cropped frames,

103
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,011
and then rotates the frames
to create this Desk View.

104
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,014
You can use the share window
function available

105
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,851
in most video conferencing apps
to share this Desk View feed,

106
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:29,256
running in parallel with
the main video camera feed.

107
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,281
Desk View can also
be used alone

108
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,017
without streaming from the main
camera at the same time.

109
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,285
But when you do stream

110
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,453
from both Desk View
and the main camera,

111
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,057
we recommend enabling
Center Stage on the main camera

112
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,560
for a better framing
to capture face and body there.

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,696
The feature is supported
when the phone is placed

114
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,732
in either landscape
or portrait orientation.

115
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,069
The portrait orientation
provides the most versatility,

116
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,172
as there's a larger
vertical field of view.

117
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,008
There's also
a Desk View camera API

118
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,277
to provide customized
integration

119
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,413
suitable for your application.

120
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,883
I will talk about the API
in a moment.

121
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,218
During a video conferencing call
on your Mac,

122
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,454
we want you
to focus on the session

123
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,922
but we also want to make sure

124
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,358
you are not missing
anything important.

125
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,760
When Continuity Camera
is in use,

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,763
all notifications on your phone
will be silenced

127
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:49,169
and important call notifications
will be forwarded on your Mac.

128
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,670
Bye, Eric!

129
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,273
Eric: Bye, Karen!

130
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,246
Karen: We've just talked about

131
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,416
all the great experiences
available to users

132
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,153
without writing a single line
of new code in your application.

133
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,923
But with some adoption
of new APIs,

134
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,559
you can make
the Continuity Camera experience

135
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:16,596
even more magical and polished
in your app.

136
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,164
Now that most users will get

137
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,834
at least two camera devices
on the Mac,

138
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,404
we've thought more on how
cameras should be managed.

139
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,475
Prior to macOS 13, when a device
is either unplugged

140
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,845
or a better camera becomes
available on the system,

141
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,213
a manual selection step

142
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,383
is usually required
in applications.

143
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,953
We'd like to offer customers
a magical experience by

144
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:43,423
switching cameras automatically
in applications.

145
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,960
We've added two new APIs
in the AVFoundation framework

146
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,963
to help you build this function
in your app:

147
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,832
the class properties
userPreferredCamera

148
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,970
and systemPreferredCamera
on AVCaptureDevice.

149
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,407
userPreferredCamera
is a read/write property.

150
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,008
You will need
to set this property

151
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,645
whenever a user picks a camera
in the application.

152
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,081
This allows
the AVCaptureDevice class

153
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,117
to learn users' preference,
store a list of cameras

154
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:15,021
for each application
across app launches and reboots,

155
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,625
and use that information
to suggest a camera.

156
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,060
It also takes into account
whether any camera

157
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,198
becomes connected
or disconnected.

158
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,034
This property
is key-value observable

159
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,104
and intelligently returns
the best selection

160
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,273
based on user preference.

161
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,910
When the most recent preferred
device becomes disconnected,

162
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,812
it spontaneously changes

163
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,815
to the next available camera
in the list.

164
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,384
Even when there's
no user selection history

165
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,487
or none of the preferred devices
are connected,

166
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,756
the property will always
try to return

167
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,125
a camera device
that's ready to use

168
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,463
and prioritize cameras that have
been previously streamed.

169
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,666
It only returns nil
when there's no camera available

170
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,102
on the system.

171
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,806
systemPreferredCamera
is a read-only property.

172
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,842
It incorporates
userPreferredCamera

173
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,277
as well as a few other factors

174
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,515
to suggest the best choice of
cameras present on the system.

175
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:19,152
For example, this property
will return a different value

176
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,755
than userPreferredCamera when
a Continuity Camera shows up

177
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,526
signaling that it should be
automatically chosen.

178
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,963
The property also tracks
device suspensions internally

179
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,801
so it prioritizes unsuspended
devices over suspended ones.

180
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,937
This is helpful for building
automatic switching behavior

181
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,640
to change to another camera
if the built-in camera

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,544
gets suspended
from closing the MacBook lid.

183
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:48,681
Continuity Camera signals itself
to be automatically chosen

184
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,584
when the phone is placed
on a stationary stand

185
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,787
in landscape orientation,
the screen is off,

186
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,757
and either connected over USB
to the Mac

187
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,994
or within a close range
of the Mac.

188
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,364
In this scenario,
the user's intention is clear

189
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:08,034
that the device should be used
as Continuity Camera.

190
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,606
When adopting
systemPreferredCamera API,

191
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,409
you should always
key-value observe this property

192
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,545
and update your
AVCaptureSession's

193
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,980
video input device accordingly

194
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,118
to offer a magic
camera selection experience.

195
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,820
userPreferredCamera
and systemPreferredCamera

196
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,591
are already adopted
by first-party applications.

197
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,295
With more and more applications
adopting these APIs,

198
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,564
we will be able to provide
customers

199
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,167
a universal and consistent
method of camera selection

200
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,870
on Apple devices.

201
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,039
Let me show you a demo
to illustrate

202
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,908
how automatic switching
with Continuity Camera

203
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,244
looks like in FaceTime.

204
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,684
Here in FaceTime,

205
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,753
I'm in the
Automatic Camera Selection mode.

206
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,689
For applications
that want to offer both

207
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,993
manual and automatic behavior,
we recommend adding a new UI

208
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,396
for enabling and disabling
auto mode.

209
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,936
FaceTime is currently streaming
from the built-in camera.

210
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,172
When I pick up the phone
from the desk

211
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:23,209
and place it on a stand
behind the MacBook...

212
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,183
...FaceTime switches to stream
from the Continuity Camera

213
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,118
seamlessly.

214
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,920
That is where
the new class property

215
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,122
systemPreferredCamera
comes in:

216
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,125
the property value
changes to Continuity Camera

217
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,630
when the phone is in a position
ready to stream.

218
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,233
You might want to build your
application in a similar way.

219
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,869
Here's my recipe
for how to implement

220
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:55,041
Automatic Camera Selection
and manual selection mode.

221
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,910
When Automatic Camera Selection
is on,

222
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,715
start key-value observing the
systemPreferredCamera property.

223
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,652
Follow the systemPreferredCamera
whenever it changes

224
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:09,022
by updating your session's
input device.

225
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,190
In auto mode,
we highly recommend

226
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,392
still providing options

227
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,962
to let users pick a camera
by themselves.

228
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,830
When a different camera
gets picked,

229
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,500
set the userPreferredCamera
to that device,

230
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,168
which then gets reflected

231
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,572
in systemPreferredCamera
property value.

232
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,208
When Automatic Camera
Selection is off,

233
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,813
stop key-value observing the
systemPreferredCamera property.

234
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,416
Instead of following
systemPreferredCamera,

235
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,252
you will need to update
session's input device

236
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,488
with the user-picked camera
in manual mode.

237
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,724
But same as auto mode,
you still need to set

238
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,559
the userPreferredCamera
property

239
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,562
every time a user
picks a different camera,

240
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,032
so we maintain the user's
history of preferred cameras

241
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,201
and suggest the right camera
when getting back

242
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,072
to Automatic Camera Selection
mode.

243
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:03,276
For best practices on how to
incorporate userPreferredCamera

244
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,279
and systemPreferredCamera APIs,
please check out

245
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,850
the new sample app,
"Continuity Camera Sample."

246
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,187
Besides bringing a magical
webcam experience to the Mac,

247
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,990
Continuity Camera also presents
you with new opportunities

248
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,794
to harness the power of
iPhone-specific camera features

249
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,629
in your Mac app.

250
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,934
We've added a few
AVCapture APIs on macOS 13

251
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,103
to help applications
better utilize

252
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,206
Continuity Camera devices.

253
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,476
We're bringing the amazing
quality of iPhone photo captures

254
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,912
to macOS,
thanks to Continuity Camera.

255
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:44,050
First off, we support capturing
high-resolution photos.

256
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,653
Previously, macOS has only
supported photo captures

257
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,388
at video resolution.

258
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,425
Starting with macOS 13,
you will be able to capture

259
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:56,796
up to 12 megapixel photos
with Continuity Camera.

260
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,332
This can be enabled
by first setting

261
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,901
highResolutionCaptureEnabled
to true

262
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,037
on AVCapturePhotoOutput
object before starting

263
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,007
a capture session,
and then setting the

264
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,910
highResolutionPhotoEnabled
property to true

265
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,349
on your photoSettings object
for each capture.

266
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,318
In addition to capturing
high-res photos,

267
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:23,122
Continuity Camera supports
controlling how photo quality

268
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,591
should be prioritized
against speed

269
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:30,029
by first setting the maximum
photo quality prioritization

270
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,165
on the photoOutput object,

271
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:36,602
then choosing the prioritization
for each capture by setting

272
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,005
photoQualityPrioritization
property

273
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:44,110
on the AVCapturePhotoSettings
object.

274
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,280
To learn more about choosing
the right prioritization

275
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,515
for your application,
please check out

276
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,251
"Capture high-quality photos
using video formats"

277
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:58,157
in WWDC2021.

278
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,694
Another photo-related feature
is flash capture.

279
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,931
You can now set flashMode
on your photoSettings object

280
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,067
to control whether flash
should be on, off,

281
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,869
or automatically chosen

282
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,841
based on the scene
and lighting conditions.

283
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,410
We are also making
AVCaptureMetadataOutput

284
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,048
available on macOS to allow
processing timed metadata

285
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,184
produced by a capture session.

286
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,653
You can now stream
face metadata objects

287
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,091
and human body metadata
objects from iPhone.

288
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,160
Let's go through
how to setup a session

289
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,530
to receive
face metadata objects.

290
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,065
After setting up the session

291
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,467
with proper video
input and output,

292
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,971
you will need to create
an AVCaptureMetadataOutput

293
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,841
and call addOutput
to add it to the session.

294
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,711
To receive face metadata
in particular,

295
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,413
set your object types array
on the output

296
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,783
to include the face object type.

297
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,220
Make sure the metadata types
requested are supported

298
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,154
by checking

299
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,025
availableMetadataObjectTypes
property.

300
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,730
Then setup the delegate
to receive metadata callbacks.

301
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,565
After the session
starts running,

302
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,866
you will get callbacks

303
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,571
with face metadata objects
produced in real time.

304
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:22,608
Besides AVCapturePhotoOutput
and AVCaptureMetadataOutput

305
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,043
we just talked about,

306
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,713
Continuity Camera also
supports video data output,

307
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:33,319
movie file output,
and AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.

308
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,056
Here's a list of video formats
supported by Continuity Camera

309
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,691
that you'll want to be aware of

310
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:42,128
when integrating this camera
into your application.

311
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,164
It supports three
16 by 9 formats --

312
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,935
from 640 by 480 to 1080p --

313
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:53,639
and one 4 by 3 format:
1920 by 1440.

314
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,941
You can choose between formats

315
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,710
supporting up to
30 frames per second

316
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,180
or 60 frames per second,
based on the need.

317
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,284
Another major addition
is Desk View device API.

318
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:10,089
Desk View camera is exposed
as a separate AVCaptureDevice.

319
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,792
There are two ways
you can find this device.

320
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,460
First one is by looking up

321
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,129
AVCaptureDeviceType
DeskViewCamera

322
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,967
in device discovery session.

323
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,135
Alternatively,
if you already know

324
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,539
the AVCaptureDevice object
of the main video camera,

325
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,908
you can use
the companionDeskViewCamera

326
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:33,012
property on that device
to access a Desk View device.

327
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,915
This API will be helpful
to pair main camera

328
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,616
and Desk View device
when there are

329
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:42,054
multiple Continuity Camera
devices around.

330
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,457
Once you have
the AVCaptureDevice object

331
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,892
of the desired
Desk View camera,

332
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,896
you can use it with an AVCapture
video data output,

333
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,565
movie file output,

334
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,868
or video preview layer
in the capture session

335
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:00,673
just as you can
with other camera devices.

336
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,542
Desk View device currently
supports one streaming format

337
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,178
in 420v pixel format.

338
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:10,349
The resolution of the format
is 1920 by 1440,

339
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,153
and the maximum frame rate
supported is 30 fps.

340
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,422
This is the end
of the session.

341
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,491
You learned about
Continuity Camera,

342
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,161
how to build a magical camera
selection on macOS,

343
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,698
and a handful of new APIs
to integrate Continuity Camera

344
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,967
