Hi, I'm Julia
from Privacy Engineering,

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,516
and welcome to "Explore
App Tracking Transparency."

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:20,787
At Apple, we believe privacy
is a fundamental human right.

6
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,823
Part of engineering
great privacy

7
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,259
is giving people
choices and control

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,427
over how their data is used.

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,929
When people have these choices

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,165
and understand how their data
will be linked or shared,

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,803
they are more likely to trust
and engage with your app.

12
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,705
That's why,
beginning last year,

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,809
App Store policy requires apps
to receive users' permission

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,779
before tracking users
across apps and websites

15
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,115
owned by other companies
by adopting

16
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,551
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework.

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,554
Today, I'm going to talk to you
about when and how to adopt

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,090
App Tracking Transparency.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,526
First, I'll start with some
background on tracking

20
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,496
to help you understand if
and when your app needs to adopt

21
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,866
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework.

22
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,335
Then, I'll highlight some
key things to keep in mind

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,338
when adopting the framework
in practice.

24
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,441
Let's get started with some
background on tracking.

25
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,512
So, how is tracking defined
for App Tracking Transparency?

26
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,815
Tracking refers to linking
user or device data

27
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,718
collected from your app
with user or device data

28
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,421
collected from other
companies' apps, websites,

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,990
or offline properties
for targeted advertising

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,993
or advertising-measurement
purposes.

31
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,996
Tracking also refers
to sharing user or device data

32
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,132
with data brokers.

33
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,001
Let's talk through
some example scenarios

34
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,271
to better understand
how tracking is defined.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,540
First, let's look
at an advertising scenario

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,910
that doesn't involve tracking.

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,646
Suppose I download
an app called Pal About,

38
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,881
and the Pal About app
has a feature

39
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,150
that lets me search
for places and events

40
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,152
that are happening nearby.

41
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,022
Now suppose I use Pal About
to search for places

42
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,225
that serve waffles near me,
which results in Pal About

43
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,228
storing waffles
as an interest of mine.

44
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,531
Pal About later wants to show
an ad for breakfast places

45
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,534
targeting people
who like breakfast foods.

46
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,971
Using the data Pal About stores
about me from my searches,

47
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,041
Pal About shows me
the breakfast ad.

48
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,378
In this example,
Pal About doesn't link my data

49
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,446
with any data
from an app or website

50
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,549
owned by another company
to show me the breakfast ad,

51
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,354
so this scenario would
not be considered tracking.

52
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,524
For another example that
wouldn't be considered tracking,

53
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,961
suppose the company that owns
Pal About -- Pal About Inc. --

54
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,398
has another app that I use
called Pal About Plus.

55
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,101
And Pal About's server links
together data collected about me

56
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,471
in Pal About Plus,
like my interest in tacos,

57
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,008
with data collected about me
in Pal About.

58
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,545
After linking this data,
Pal About shows me an ad

59
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,882
for a taco truck using
the fact I like tacos

60
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,484
collected from Pal About Plus.

61
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,220
In this example,
the Pal About app doesn't need

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,690
to get my permission to track
because it isn't tracking.

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,460
Pal About doesn't link
my data from Pal About

64
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,495
with any data
from an app or website

65
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,831
owned by another company.

66
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,934
Let's now consider a scenario
that would require Pal About

67
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,170
to get permission to track.

68
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,238
Suppose there's
a food delivery app I use

69
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,809
that's owned by a different
company than Pal About.

70
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,343
And I've used
the food delivery app

71
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,646
to place orders late at night.

72
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,681
When I signed up for
the food delivery app,

73
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,851
I gave the app
my email address --

74
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,321
the same email address I used
to sign up for Pal About

75
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,425
and that Pal About stores
for my account.

76
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,527
The food delivery app
includes code

77
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,229
that shares my email address

78
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,633
and the fact I often order
at night with Pal About.

79
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,237
The Pal About server uses my
email address to link together

80
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,540
my interest in waffles,
collected by the Pal About app,

81
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,142
to the fact I order at night,

82
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,345
collected in
the food delivery app.

83
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,048
Finally, Pal About
uses the combination

84
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,917
of my ordering habits
and my interest in waffles

85
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,552
to show me
an ad for a restaurant

86
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,322
that serves all-day breakfast.

87
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,491
This scenario
would require Pal About

88
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,459
to request permission to track

89
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,129
because it linked user data
from Pal About --

90
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,363
my email address --

91
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,532
with another company's
user data --

92
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,868
my email and habit
of ordering at night --

93
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,170
for advertising purposes.

94
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,473
In this example, data is
linked together across apps

95
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,042
with an email address.

96
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,012
Even if the email address
or another user identifier

97
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,182
is hashed before it is used
to link data,

98
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,318
it would still require
permission to track

99
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,421
because it would still be
linking data about a user

100
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,859
from the app with another
company's data about that user.

101
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,329
The type of identifier
and whether or not it is hashed

102
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,432
doesn't change the fact
it is being used for tracking,

103
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,303
which is what
requires permission.

104
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,838
Another thing
you'll need to consider

105
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:08,141
to determine if your app needs
to request permission to track

106
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,812
is how third-party SDKs use
and share data from your app.

107
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,980
As a developer,

108
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,417
you're responsible for
the behavior of your whole app.

109
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,887
Returning to our example,
suppose the Pal About developer

110
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,056
hasn't written
any code themselves

111
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,358
that would require
permission to track,

112
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,361
but would like to include
a third-party SDK in their app

113
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,398
for advertising-measurement
purposes.

114
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,867
Whether Pal About
needs permission to track

115
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,571
in order to include the SDK
depends on whether or not

116
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,640
the SDK combines
user data from Pal About

117
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,145
with user data from other
companies' apps or websites.

118
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:49,449
For example, if the SDK
shares user data from Pal About

119
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,519
to provide analytics
about ads in Pal About,

120
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,789
but doesn't link the user data
it collects from Pal About

121
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,991
with user data
from other companies,

122
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:02,762
it doesn't require
permission to track.

123
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,531
Now suppose instead,

124
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:09,035
the SDK shares user data from
Pal About with an ad network,

125
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,072
and the ad network
links the data it receives

126
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,974
about how I use Pal About

127
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,810
with data about ads I saw
in other companies' apps

128
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,547
to compare the impact
of ad campaigns in those apps.

129
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,483
This requires Pal About
to request users' permission

130
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,920
to track because this SDK
is tracking.

131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,123
This is considered tracking
regardless of whether Pal About

132
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,859
uses the SDK
for those purposes,

133
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,429
or even if Pal About
only gets aggregate reporting

134
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,132
after Pal About
users' data is linked

135
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,202
with other companies'
users' data.

136
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,238
If you're unsure about
whether an SDK you want to use

137
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,906
would contain code
that would require

138
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,842
App Tracking Transparency,

139
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,345
you should ask the developer
of that SDK.

140
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,382
This responsibility applies
not just to SDKs,

141
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:59,519
but to any libraries or
third-party code your app uses.

142
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,623
So far, we've looked at examples
that involve linking user data.

143
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,158
Now let's look
at another scenario

144
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,860
that's considered tracking:

145
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,863
sharing user or device data
with data brokers.

146
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,166
First, how are data brokers
defined?

147
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,569
Data brokers are defined by law
in some jurisdictions.

148
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,539
But in general,
a data broker is a company

149
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,575
that regularly collects
and sells, licenses,

150
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,111
or otherwise discloses
to third parties

151
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,981
the personal information
of particular end users

152
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,451
with whom the business does
not have a direct relationship.

153
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,622
Let's look at sharing data with
a data broker in an example.

154
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,858
Suppose the Pal About app
includes client code

155
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,794
that sends my interest
in waffles

156
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,097
and an account identifier
to a data broker.

157
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,132
This scenario counts as tracking

158
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,101
whether or not
the data that is shared

159
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,370
is linked with data
from other companies

160
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,239
for advertising
or advertising measurement.

161
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,575
Sharing of user data
with a data broker

162
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,379
requires permission to track.

163
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,648
And even if
Pal About client code

164
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,250
doesn't directly send
my account identifier

165
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,986
and my interest in waffles
to the data broker,

166
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,357
but instead this interest
is sent to Pal About's server

167
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,525
and the server
later shares accounts

168
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,295
interested in waffles
with the data broker,

169
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,864
this would require
getting permission to track

170
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,066
even though my device
isn't communicating

171
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,836
with the data broker directly.

172
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,105
We've now talked through
how the definition of tracking

173
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,507
applies to some
example scenarios.

174
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,477
For more information about
how App Tracking Transparency

175
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,312
defines tracking,
you can visit

176
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,448
the User Privacy
and Data Use page.

177
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,584
Now, if you've determined
that your app

178
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,352
would like to track users,

179
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,288
you'll need to ask for
and obtain the user's permission

180
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,957
before you do so.

181
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,658
Here's how.

182
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,762
To ask for permission
for your app to track,

183
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,598
you'll need to present
the app tracking authorization

184
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,800
request prompt by calling

185
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,504
the requestTrackingAuthorization
method.

186
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,707
Calling this method will cause
a system permission alert --

187
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,211
like this one for Pal About --
to appear over your app.

188
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,046
This is a one-time prompt.

189
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,449
The system will remember
the user's choice

190
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,650
and won't prompt again

191
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,421
unless the app is uninstalled
and reinstalled.

192
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,123
The next thing you'll
need to do is provide

193
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:23,363
a NSUserTrackingUsageDescription
key in your app's info.plist.

194
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,866
The string provided here will
be shown in the system prompt

195
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,470
and informs the user why
the app is requesting permission

196
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,207
to use data for tracking
the user or the device.

197
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,877
A great purpose string is clear,
concise, and helps users

198
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,281
understand why they are
being asked to allow tracking.

199
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,217
This string doesn't need
to include the app's name,

200
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,719
because the system
will automatically identify

201
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,055
the requesting app
and display the app name

202
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,391
in the system prompt.

203
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,327
If you don't include
a usage-description string,

204
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,864
your app will crash
when the system prompt is shown.

205
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,634
Finally, use
trackingAuthorizationStatus

206
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,404
to determine the user's
app-tracking permission status

207
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,639
for your app.

208
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,242
If a user has selected
Allow for this app,

209
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,678
then you have their permission
to link their activity

210
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,614
in that app across
other apps and websites

211
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,250
as long as their
tracking authorization status

212
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,652
remains authorized.

213
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,021
Users can change
and grant or revoke

214
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,291
their tracking authorization
at any time,

215
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,329
so make sure your app checks the
tracking authorization status

216
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,932
each time it is launched
and only continues to track

217
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,602
when the value of the
tracking authorization status

218
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,804
is authorized.

219
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,341
Users can control whether apps
have their permission to track

220
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,877
on a per-app basis.

221
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,312
Just because a user
has given one of your apps

222
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,282
permission to track doesn't mean
you have their permission

223
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,986
to track in another app
owned by the same company.

224
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,689
Different apps must each
individually request permission

225
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,526
from the user
for that particular app

226
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,961
before data from
that app can be linked

227
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,097
to apps or websites
owned by other companies

228
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,634
for marketing or advertising.

229
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,102
If your app doesn't have

230
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,371
tracking authorization
for a user,

231
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,307
there are a couple things
to keep in mind.

232
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,210
First, per the App Store
review guidelines,

233
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,979
your app must not gate
any of its functionality

234
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,716
on whether the user agrees
to allow tracking.

235
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,554
Second, the IDFA API
will return all zeros

236
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,190
if the user has asked your app
not to track.

237
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,226
If a user has opted
out of tracking,

238
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,962
there are nontracking
alternatives for advertising

239
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,498
or advertising measurement
for your app.

240
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,035
For example, your app could
choose to serve first-party ads

241
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,836
or contextual ads.

242
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,140
And for advertising measurement,
we continue to build and improve

243
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,276
privacy preserving
ad-attribution technologies

244
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,512
that ad networks can adopt.

245
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,814
For more information
about recent improvements

246
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,718
to SKAdNetwork and private click
measurement, you can refer to

247
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,287
"Meet privacy preserving
ad attribution"

248
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,824
and "What's new in SKAdNetwork."

249
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,760
You'll also need to declare
what data your app uses

250
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,931
to track for display in your
app's privacy nutrition label.

251
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,933
Filling out your
privacy nutrition label

252
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,202
when submitting your app
to the App Store

253
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,404
and getting permission
to track using

254
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,773
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework

255
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,443
are two separate steps
that are both required

256
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,746
if your app would like to use
data for tracking.

257
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,115
For more information
about nutrition labels

258
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,883
and how to fill them out
for your app,

259
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,220
see "Create your
Privacy Nutrition Label."

260
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,523
Finally, let's talk
about fingerprinting.

261
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,560
With permission,
tracking is allowed.

262
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,496
But fingerprinting
is never allowed.

263
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,698
Regardless of whether
a user gives your app

264
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,201
permission to track,
fingerprinting --

265
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,902
or using signals
from the device

266
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,405
to try to identify
the device or user --

267
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,539
is not allowed

268
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,677
per the Apple Developer Program
License Agreement.

269
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,114
Some examples of user or device
data used for fingerprinting

270
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,549
include properties
of a user's web browser

271
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,018
and its configuration,

272
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,253
the user's device
and its configuration,

273
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,557
the user's location, or
the user's network connection.

274
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,060
Collecting any data
solely for the purpose

275
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,197
of generating a fingerprint
is also not allowed.

276
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,800
It's important people
have transparency and control

277
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,870
over how their data
is used for tracking.

278
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,005
We hope that by tuning in
to this session,

279
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,174
you now have the tools
you need to determine

280
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,277
when and how to give people
that control by adopting

281
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,713
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework.

282
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,148
Thanks for watching.

283
