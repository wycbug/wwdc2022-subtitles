Hi, I'm Lynn,

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,081
a design producer
for Siri and Shortcuts.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,983
And today, I'm going
to tell you a bit more

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,317
about the new App Intents
framework

7
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:21,154
and how you can use it
to design great App Shortcuts.

8
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,757
Here at Apple, we know
that people love using Siri

9
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,160
and Spotlight to accelerate
common tasks across devices,

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,595
like this.

11
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,832
Remind me to buy garlic.

12
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,737
Set a timer for 20 minutes.

13
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,613
These habitual tasks
can be easily completed

14
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,616
outside their respective apps,
and making them available

15
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,452
via Siri and Spotlight
gives people flexibility

16
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,221
in how they interact
with their device

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,857
and how they get things done.

18
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:00,260
Shortcuts are how you can offer
people that same flexibility

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,231
to accomplish key tasks
from your app throughout the OS.

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,134
And all shortcuts begin
with a fundamental component

21
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,103
called actions, which
represent an individual task

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,039
that people can complete
with your app,

23
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:16,109
such as creating a reminder
or sending a message.

24
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,546
This foundation can be used
in a couple different ways.

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,783
First, for custom shortcuts,
which people can create

26
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,818
using one or more actions
from apps;

27
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,387
that is, your app and others.

28
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,757
Or an action can be used
to create an App Shortcut,

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,559
created by
app developers like you,

30
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,128
containing one action
from your app.

31
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,098
And while in the past,
people needed to find and tap

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,434
the Add to Siri button
to enable each new app shortcut

33
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,304
you created,
now, with iOS 16,

34
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,139
the App Shortcuts
you create for your app

35
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,776
will be automatically available
as soon as your app is installed.

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,813
That means they'll be
available in Siri,

37
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,548
visible in Spotlight,

38
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,216
and featured
in the Shortcuts app,

39
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,185
making it easier than ever
for people to access

40
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:02,389
their favorite features
from your app throughout the OS.

41
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,591
Today I'm going to walk through
a few different areas

42
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,394
to help you create
unforgettable App Shortcuts.

43
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,929
I'll start with how to select
the right features

44
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,031
from your app
to turn into shortcuts,

45
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,699
and how to name them.

46
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,801
Then, I'll walk through
some best practices

47
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,303
for presenting your visuals

48
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,638
and for collecting
required information.

49
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,108
And finally, I'll let you know
how you can tell people

50
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,943
about your new shortcuts.

51
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,545
So let's jump in.

52
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,848
Now your app
has a wide range of features.

53
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,449
But we know that some things
lend themselves

54
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,985
better than others
to becoming great shortcuts.

55
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,887
So what should you look for?

56
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,189
Think about the features
people love in your app,

57
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,159
and then focus on tasks
that are self-contained,

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,895
meaning they can be completed
outside your app;

59
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,130
and straightforward,

60
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,432
in that they're efficient
to get through.

61
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,401
To give these principles
a bit more context,

62
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,603
let's take a look at
a sample meditation app.

63
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,773
We'll just call it "Meditation."

64
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,641
Now a great
App Shortcut is one

65
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,611
that actually doesn't require
your app in focus at all.

66
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,013
You're looking for a lightweight
task that can be completed

67
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,217
via Siri or via search
in its entirety.

68
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,120
For our new Meditation app,
that'd be something like this.

69
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,025
Start sleep meditation.

70
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,995
Voiceover: Take a deep breath,
close your eyes,

71
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,563
and leave the day behind.

72
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,035
It's easy to kick this off
without opening the app,

73
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,271
and it just starts playing.

74
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,406
You also want to make sure
the shortcuts you author

75
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,774
are straightforward.

76
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,810
They should feel effortless
to get through.

77
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,579
Tasks that require a lot
of input may be too tedious

78
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,815
and time-consuming
for a shortcut.

79
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:40,153
For example, a lengthy,
multistep survey like this one

80
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,490
wouldn't be appropriate
for an App Shortcut.

81
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,326
Instead, focus on
uncomplicated tasks

82
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,061
that people can succeed
at quickly,

83
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,864
and that they can remember even
when they're not using your app,

84
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,799
like this.

85
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,778
So the best features from
your app to turn into shortcuts

86
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,481
are self-contained
and straightforward.

87
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,716
They can be completed
without the app in focus

88
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,018
and are uncomplicated
to get through.

89
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,055
And all in all, there may not
be so many of these.

90
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,291
The maximum you can create
is 10, but in most cases,

91
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,093
the key features of your app
can be captured

92
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,963
in two to five
high-quality app shortcuts,

93
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,631
and we strongly recommend
keeping your set

94
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,400
as focused as possible.

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,936
Now, as important
as selecting the right features

96
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,439
to become app shortcuts,
is authoring a great phrase

97
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,608
to name them.

98
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,744
This name is really the hero
phrase for your shortcut.

99
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,947
It appears in the Shortcuts app
under your app's header,

100
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,683
it's how your shortcut will be
referenced in Spotlight

101
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,087
and it's what people will say
to Siri to invoke your shortcut.

102
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,055
So where to start?

103
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,857
The first important thing
to remember

104
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,895
when you're crafting that hero
phrase is to keep it brief.

105
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,029
You want your
app shortcut phrase

106
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,430
to be easy to remember

107
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,667
and to clearly communicate
its function.

108
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,537
As a requirement, you'll need
to include your app name.

109
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,505
But you can be
creative about it!

110
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,274
See if you can incorporate
your app name

111
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,342
directly into
the invocation phrase,

112
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,112
like here with Voice Memo

113
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,614
or here with Panera.

114
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,717
And the app name in this phrase
can be your official app name

115
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,221
or any of the alternative names
you submitted to the App Store.

116
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,990
In this case, Panera Bread
is the official app name,

117
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,460
but the Panera synonym feels
more natural in the phrase.

118
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,665
And here's how that could look
with our app, Meditation.

119
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,135
Let's dig a little deeper
with the Voice Memo example.

120
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,905
I'll turn on my transcriptions
so we can see my speech.

121
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,241
Remember that the name
you choose for your App Shortcut

122
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,244
is also what people will say to
Siri to invoke it, and you need

123
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,546
to provide thoughtful
natural language variations

124
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,715
to ensure it works
for whatever similar phrases

125
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,250
people might say.

126
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,454
For example, for this shortcut,
named Record Voice Memo,

127
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,756
I would need
to explicitly specify

128
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,227
"Start Voice Memo"
and "New Voice Memo"

129
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,930
as synonyms,
otherwise they won't work.

130
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,732
Be sufficiently thorough here.

131
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,134
You want to try to capture
all the alternative phrases

132
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,869
people might say.

133
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,539
But -- and this is
a bit of a judgment call --

134
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,841
make sure you're not straying
too far from the core purpose

135
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,876
of your shortcut
and entering into a new meaning

136
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,178
with these phrases.

137
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,948
In this case, the intent is
truly to create not to save.

138
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,151
And remember, you will have
to go through this exercise

139
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,621
of providing thorough synonyms
for every language

140
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,156
that your app is published
to ensure a robust experience

141
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,891
around the world.

142
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,929
So I've talked about
the importance

143
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,765
of keeping your app shortcut
name brief and memorable,

144
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,534
creative strategies
for incorporating your app name,

145
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,436
and the value of generating
thorough synonyms

146
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,640
and translating those synonyms
to other languages.

147
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,941
The last thing
I want to talk about

148
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,643
when it comes
to naming your shortcut

149
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,879
is how and when to use
a dynamic parameter.

150
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,781
You can now use
a dynamic parameter

151
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,549
directly in the name
of your shortcut

152
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,551
to create multiple variations
on the phrase

153
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,688
that people can say to Siri
or see in Spotlight.

154
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,790
Let's take a look at an example.

155
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,293
So for our Meditation app,
the dynamic parameter

156
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,728
could be different types
of meditation.

157
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,930
And you can see how
this provides the flexibility

158
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,234
to directly ask
for those different types.

159
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,970
But there are a couple things
to note about this parameter.

160
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,839
First, you can only have
one dynamic parameter

161
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,275
in your phrase,
and it can only be used

162
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,978
to select from a finite list.

163
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,946
You want to make sure
that other values in the list

164
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,482
are predictable since people
won't have this list of options

165
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,618
in front of them for reference.

166
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,254
This is a good example because
people are likely familiar

167
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,956
with the different meditation
types from using the app,

168
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,992
and it's also a small list.

169
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,261
Other good examples
might be recent restaurants

170
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:45,332
that are front of mind or
different rooms in the home.

171
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,068
A bad example would be
something with infinite options,

172
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,703
like a time value.

173
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,805
You don't want to use
a dynamic parameter here,

174
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,807
but instead, prompt
for additional information

175
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,041
as needed.

176
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,677
I'll talk more
about that in a bit.

177
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,546
Last thing to note
is that this list

178
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,515
of possible parameter values
can be updated any time

179
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,651
your app is open,
so you can ensure

180
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,988
it consistently contains
up-to-date and relevant values.

181
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,257
Now, each parameter value,

182
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,360
in combination
with the App Intent,

183
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,596
creates a unique variant
of your app shortcut.

184
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,298
So for starting a meditation,

185
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,867
you'd have this
unparameterized version

186
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,138
and each parameterized version,
like Start Sleep Meditation,

187
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,908
Start Gratitude Meditation,
and all the others.

188
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,477
These are automatically
generated

189
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:34,114
and displayed in the Shortcuts
app, as you see here,

190
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,684
and shown as individual rows
in Spotlight.

191
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,153
These parameters are also
visible in the Shortcuts editor

192
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,490
when you provide a parameter
summary for your action.

193
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,058
When someone taps
on the parameter,

194
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,228
your options will appear
in a menu like this.

195
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,230
To learn more about actions
and how they appear

196
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,364
in the Shortcuts editor,

197
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,000
check out this talk from last
year on designing great actions

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,437
for Shortcuts, Siri,
and Suggestions.

199
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,339
The last important consideration
when it comes

200
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,342
to including a dynamic parameter
is making sure it's clear

201
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,044
which part of the phrase
is a parameter.

202
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,914
As I mentioned, you can only
have one dynamic parameter

203
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,484
per app shortcut, but if you had
this as your app shortcut,

204
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,788
the second part of
the phrase -- "nature sounds" --

205
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,590
seems like a second parameter
that can be changed.

206
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,726
This could make people
think they can say

207
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,429
"gratitude meditation
with ocean sounds,"

208
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,063
when in fact, only
the first part of the phrase

209
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,632
can be changed.

210
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,501
The solution here
is to keep it simple.

211
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,037
If it feels too complicated
when you say it aloud,

212
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,772
it probably is.

213
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,007
And if that additional
information

214
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,375
is absolutely required,

215
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,310
you can ask for it
in a subsequent step,

216
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,047
and I'll provide some tips
on how to do that later.

217
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,582
Looking back at everything
I mentioned

218
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,385
about selecting features,
naming your shortcut,

219
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,555
and using dynamic parameters,
one theme stands out,

220
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,623
and that's to make it memorable.

221
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,959
Within your app,
people can explore,

222
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,929
get drawn into features,
and learn new flows.

223
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,864
But with shortcuts,
your main goal is to create

224
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,334
a few focused experiences
that people can quickly learn,

225
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,404
remember,
and grow to depend on.

226
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,206
Now let's take a look at
some visual considerations

227
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,908
for your app shortcuts.

228
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,944
Custom Snippets
and Live Activities

229
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,646
provide you with an opportunity
to present information,

230
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,749
request clarifications,
and surface your app identity,

231
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,985
and I want to share some tips
for making them as beautiful

232
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,521
and effective as possible.

233
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,991
Unlike most of your apps that
likely use opaque backgrounds,

234
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,827
snippets use
a semitranslucent material.

235
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,463
Place elements from your app
on top of this material

236
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,399
instead of filling the visual
with an opaque background.

237
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,168
You can see an example here,
with elements

238
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,036
from the Weather app
integrating seamlessly

239
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,706
into the Siri snippet.

240
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,242
And when you draw your text,
use vibrant label colors

241
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,678
to guarantee great contrast
over the translucent background.

242
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,146
Doing this ensures
that your text

243
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,950
will automatically look great
in Dark Mode too.

244
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,987
Now there are two ways
to show results in iOS 16:

245
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,956
Live Activities
and Custom Snippets.

246
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,691
If you're not sure
which one to use,

247
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,093
think about whether
people would benefit

248
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,562
from continuous access
to this information,

249
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,664
such as transit progress
for a food order

250
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,533
or a timer counting down.

251
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,202
If so, use a Live Activity.

252
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,437
This will make the content
continuously glanceable,

253
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,507
even on the Lock Screen,
until the event has ended.

254
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,343
If not, and the shortcut
is a self-contained action

255
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,447
or piece of information,
use a Custom Snippet.

256
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,449
Let's take a closer look
at the iOS snippet

257
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,785
and a couple
of the key elements it contains.

258
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,488
Here, you see
the supporting dialog.

259
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,856
This is what Siri speaks

260
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,793
and is intended to accompany
your custom visual.

261
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,963
Together, they communicate
all the necessary information

262
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,165
for this step of the shortcut.

263
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,101
Now by default, your custom
visual will consistently appear

264
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,903
with supporting dialog.

265
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,706
But in this example, you can
see that the supporting dialog

266
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,676
is fully redundant
with your visual response.

267
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,945
When that's the case,
you should suppress this dialog

268
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:56,149
in your source code
so that it won't be shown.

269
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,552
But the presentation of your
information goes beyond iOS,

270
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,854
and you'll need to think about
other devices in the ecosystem

271
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,456
as well.

272
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,125
For voice-only products,
like AirPods,

273
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,362
Siri will read out
the full dialog you provide.

274
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,697
For these platforms,
it's important

275
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:14,200
that your full dialog contain
all the critical information

276
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,870
from both your custom visual
and any supporting dialog.

277
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,772
Be sure to provide
both types of dialog,

278
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,308
so that people have access
to all the information they need

279
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,943
regardless of which device
they choose

280
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,846
to interact with your shortcut.

281
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,081
And for the first time,

282
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,084
Apple Watch now supports
Custom Snippets as well.

283
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,952
This means you should take
a look at your shortcuts

284
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,288
in watchOS 9
and make sure they look great

285
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,390
on that platform as well.

286
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,325
And know that this may
require you to make changes

287
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,493
to your layout.

288
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,128
Here you can see
how the Coffee app

289
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,497
repositioned the address line
on watchOS

290
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,768
to fall beneath the header
to help with readability.

291
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,571
Just to recap
these first few visual tips.

292
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,072
I walked through how
to integrate elements

293
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,942
from your app into
the translucent background,

294
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,478
the importance of using
vibrant label colors,

295
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,447
the appropriate time to use
snippets versus live activities,

296
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,316
and how to adapt
your dialog and visuals

297
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,319
for different platforms
and contexts.

298
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,421
Now, let's talk about Spotlight.

299
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:12,992
In iOS 16, your app's shortcuts
will also appear in Spotlight.

300
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,462
If someone searches for your
app name, one app shortcut --

301
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,831
the first one in
your App Shortcuts array --

302
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:23,436
will appear as a Siri Suggestion
below your app as a top hit.

303
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,872
They can also search directly
for the name of the shortcut,

304
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,074
and any app shortcut
that matches the search term

305
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,109
will appear.

306
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,478
Finally, if your app
is a Siri Suggestion

307
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,347
when someone
first launches Spotlight,

308
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,582
your top shortcut
will also appear here,

309
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,986
even before anything has been
typed into the search field.

310
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,821
This is all really exciting,
because it provides

311
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,457
an opportunity for people
to learn about your shortcuts

312
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,760
just by looking for your app
or by using their phone.

313
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,229
You'll also notice
that each unique app shortcut

314
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,332
is decorated with a symbol
on the right side.

315
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,468
Be sure to review
the SF Symbols library

316
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,704
and select one for each
of your app shortcuts

317
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,174
that accurately reflects
its intent.

318
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:05,078
Also, know that the order of
your actions and your parameters

319
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,146
will influence the order
your app shortcuts appear

320
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,948
in Spotlight.

321
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,517
Actions can only be reordered
with app updates,

322
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,986
but as I mentioned earlier,
the order of your parameters

323
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,055
is truly dynamic
and can be updated

324
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,291
any time your app is open.

325
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,627
This in turn impacts
how your shortcuts are shown.

326
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,697
Here, you see that
Reorder Coffee App Cappuccino

327
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,900
is first in the Shortcuts app
and takes the single slot

328
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,869
in Spotlight.

329
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,739
But maybe this customer ordered
a chai latte more recently,

330
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,341
and you want that to be
your suggestion in Spotlight.

331
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,277
You can make it the first item
returned by your entity query

332
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,047
or dynamic options provider,
and it will become first

333
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,717
in the Shortcuts app
and in Spotlight.

334
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,019
And as the number
of parameters increases,

335
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,323
this prioritization may become
even more important.

336
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,158
But be sure to pick
a meaningful heuristic --

337
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,294
such as recency or frequency --
to drive the order,

338
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,998
so that it doesn't feel
random or unpredictable.

339
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,868
And one last thing --
pick a color for your shortcuts

340
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,603
in the Shortcuts app.

341
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,838
We have a bunch of great colors
for you to choose from,

342
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,474
and all your shortcuts will use
this color in the app.

343
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,877
So pick one that complements
your app icon nicely

344
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,780
and don't just stick
with the default.

345
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,683
Now, as quick and contained
as your shortcuts aspire to be,

346
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,918
there may still be times
when you need

347
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,288
to collect some information
in order to see a task though.

348
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,490
I'm going to walk through
a few different ways to do that

349
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,959
and when to use each one.

350
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,396
Take a phrase like this one that
doesn't contain a parameter.

351
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,465
Sometimes, you can make
an informed decision

352
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,802
and assume a value and
then proceed with the action.

353
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:36,702
One example here

354
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,906
might be starting a meditation
that was already in progress.

355
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,675
But other times, in the face
of an ambiguous request,

356
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,611
you'll need to ask
for more information.

357
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,447
When possible, try to make
a meaningful assumption

358
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,651
and present it as an option
for people to confirm.

359
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,487
This is called
a Parameter Confirmation.

360
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,857
These assumptions could be based
on remembering a prior selection

361
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,660
or based on something
like the most popular option.

362
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,262
Parameter Confirmations
are a nice, efficient way

363
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,400
to be sure you have the detail
you need and continue on.

364
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,435
But let's say the person has
never gone through this shortcut

365
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,105
before and you don't have
a single parameter to offer.

366
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,042
Another option is
to provide a short list.

367
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,711
This is called a disambiguation
and helps people

368
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,446
that are unfamiliar
with the shortcut

369
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,448
learn the possible values.

370
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,550
Just keep in mind
that this is best for lists

371
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,552
of five values or less,

372
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,722
because in voice-only
modalities, such as AirPods,

373
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,892
Siri will read
this entire list aloud.

374
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,360
What kind of meditation?

375
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,199
Focus, Gratitude, Walking,
Compassion, or Sleep?

376
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,735
Sometimes, you need
to collect an open-ended value

377
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,871
that isn't compatible
with a short list,

378
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:48,074
like a number, a location,
or a string.

379
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,844
In these situations, you can
use an open-ended request.

380
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,512
This has the fewest
guardrails though,

381
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,248
since there are
no suggested values

382
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,550
and people can say
anything in response,

383
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,452
so make sure it's clear
what type of information

384
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,020
your app is expecting.

385
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021
In this case,

386
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,558
it's apparent that the response
should be a time value.

387
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,261
The App Intent framework does
provide a set of common options

388
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:12,198
for these open-ended requests,
such as numerical values,

389
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,234
dates, or time values.

390
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,670
If your required parameter
aligns with one of these,

391
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,472
definitely select it.

392
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,008
This will allow you to benefit
from certain built-in dialog

393
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,342
and visual patterns,

394
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,211
as well as Siri's natural
language understanding

395
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,980
as it pertains to these types
of information.

396
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,083
If not, you can use
a custom entity.

397
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,819
For more information on how
to implement app entities,

398
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,690
check out this year's talk
called "Dive into App Intents."

399
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,027
Lastly, even if you have all
the information you require,

400
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,496
you may still want to do
one final confirmation --

401
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,564
what we call
an "intent confirmation" --

402
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,100
before proceeding
with your shortcut.

403
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,169
The guidance here is
to only use this step

404
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,906
for consequential actions,
be it a financial transaction,

405
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,275
a destructive action
like deleting content,

406
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,277
or an action that may
just feel high risk,

407
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,180
like sending a calendar invite
to a big group.

408
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,783
Use these appropriately
but sparingly,

409
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,152
as the goal of getting through a
shortcut as quickly as possible

410
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,654
always applies.

411
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,756
One last detail
on intent confirmations

412
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,592
is that they will always have a
pair of buttons in the snippet,

413
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,128
offering to either
proceed with -- or cancel --

414
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,930
the proposed action.

415
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,333
When confirming an intent,
buttons should contain a verb

416
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,868
reiterating the action
that is about to be taken

417
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,672
and not ambiguous words
like "confirm."

418
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,175
The App Intents framework
provides a really helpful set

419
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,078
of default verbs
with corresponding synonyms.

420
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,447
You can see
a few examples here.

421
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,950
If your intent maps to one
of these, go ahead and use it.

422
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,020
If you have a specific intent
that falls outside this group,

423
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,189
you can provide
a custom string instead

424
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,890
but be sure to provide
synonyms as well

425
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,194
so that Siri understands
all the similar phrases.

426
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,229
Last but not least,
once you've created

427
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,698
an awesome set of app shortcuts,
there are a few places

428
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,035
to surface them
for people to discover.

429
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,537
First, in place of the old
Add to Siri button

430
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,173
is a new tip for you
to feature in your app.

431
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,142
It's important that
you carefully select moments

432
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,511
within your app to surface
these tips, at a time

433
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,080
when people are likely
to benefit from the education,

434
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,217
such as immediately before
or after completing an action

435
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,619
that they may want to repeat
in the future.

436
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,989
And where appropriate,
make your tip dismissible.

437
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,325
Respect people's desire to
remove this helpful information

438
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,061
from their workflow.

439
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,897
We've also provided a button
that you can place in your app

440
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,800
to link to the Shortcuts app
directly to the landing page

441
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,770
that lists all
your app shortcuts.

442
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,438
It's an exciting year
for shortcuts,

443
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,573
with the introduction
of App Shortcuts,

444
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,176
created by you,
and seamlessly available

445
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,647
in Siri, Shortcuts,
and Spotlight.

446
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,083
With dynamic parameters
in the invocation phrase,

447
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,553
Custom Snippets on watchOS,
new tips, and more,

448
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,889
there's a lot to explore.

449
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,624
And with all the info
I walked through today

450
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,959
on selecting and naming
great app shortcuts,

451
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,961
refining your presentation
and flow,

452
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,863
and including tips
for discoverability,

453
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,864
you're well on your way

454
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,100
to an amazing
App Shortcuts experience.

455
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,601
We can't wait to see
what you create,

456
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,703
and have a great
rest of WWDC.
