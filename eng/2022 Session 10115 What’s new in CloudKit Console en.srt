Hi, I'm Alex Young,
and I'm an engineer

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,515
on the iCloud developer
experience team.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,418
CloudKit is an easy way
to create great experiences

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,321
by allowing users
to effortlessly synchronize data

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,624
between devices.

8
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,460
CloudKit Console helps to make
this even easier by providing

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,731
tools that let you work with
your app's schema and data.

10
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm going to share several
updates to CloudKit Console

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,369
that will help you
understand and debug

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,171
your application's
schema and data.

13
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,909
First, I'll walk through
how to use hidden containers,

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,311
then dive into a new way
you can view records

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,713
using iCloud accounts,

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,415
and finally,
there are some great updates

17
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,151
for working with shared zones.

18
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,054
It's common to create lots of
containers while in development,

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,657
and only focus
on a few later on.

20
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,891
You can better organize this

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,694
with the new
hidden containers feature.

22
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,629
In CloudKit Console,
you can choose

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,499
which containers
are hidden or visible.

24
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,234
Hidden containers
aren't just hidden

25
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,403
from the lists
inside the Console,

26
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,538
but also across
all developer tools,

27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,740
including Xcode.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,009
Even better,
when a container is hidden,

29
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,878
it applies at the team level,

30
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,681
which means all of your test
and prototype containers

31
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,084
no longer clutter
your teammates' views.

32
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,655
I'll open the Console and use
this new functionality now.

33
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,424
Once you're signed in
to the Console,

34
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:34,428
open the container selector
from the top-level navigation.

35
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,830
Then click Manage Containers.

36
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,466
This displays a new menu
that allows you to toggle

37
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,704
the visibility of every
container in the current team.

38
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,773
For people with several teams,
you can switch between them

39
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,576
using the account menu
in the top right.

40
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,378
Then you can go on
to hide containers

41
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,381
in your other teams as well.

42
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,351
Here's the container
from WWDC21,

43
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,052
which isn't needed anymore.

44
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,655
I can hide it, like this.

45
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,691
And if you refresh
the container list in Xcode,

46
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,962
you'll see the containers
are now hidden there too.

47
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,565
I'll tell you about
a new addition to the Console

48
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,900
that lets you view data
as iCloud accounts

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,236
instead of your
developer account.

50
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,806
This is called Act As iCloud.

51
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,010
Sometimes, it can be difficult
to understand why certain users

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,814
are experiencing trouble with
data in their private databases.

53
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,649
Now you have the ability
to sign in

54
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:34,087
as a separate iCloud account
to view private data.

55
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,156
When you're logged in
with an iCloud account,

56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,226
CloudKit Console's query tools
work as you'd expect

57
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,229
from the perspective
of that account.

58
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,497
This helps you debug

59
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,868
development and production
issues on behalf of your users.

60
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,503
I'll demonstrate
this in the Console

61
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,572
to illustrate how it works.

62
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,709
This query was performed
using my developer account.

63
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,778
I'm going to switch
to an iCloud account

64
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:01,014
to show how
the query results change.

65
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,052
First, navigate to the
Act As iCloud account menu item.

66
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,254
This will open a dialog
that allows you to sign in

67
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,256
as an iCloud account.

68
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,393
When I sign in, the context of
the Console is going to change.

69
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,729
Now you'll see a banner
at the top of the page.

70
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,964
All subsequent operations
will be performed

71
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:22,402
using the iCloud account instead
of your developer account.

72
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,704
You can query records
and view zones,

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,909
but you cannot perform
schema operations.

74
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,911
As you can see,
the results of this query

75
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,881
are for my iCloud account,
not my developer account.

76
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,950
Switching to another
container or environment

77
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,586
will stop acting
as the iCloud account.

78
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,555
You can also click
the button in the banner

79
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,325
to stop the Act As session.

80
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,228
Remember, acting as an iCloud
account applies to records,

81
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,597
not schema,
so this feature only works

82
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,100
in the data parts
of the Console.

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,370
Attempting to access schema
will halt the Act As session.

84
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,272
This feature helps you
to better understand

85
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,374
how your data
is used in production

86
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:06,279
and investigate data-related
bugs more effectively.

87
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,615
Encrypted fields
remain unreadable to you

88
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,851
when acting as another account.

89
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,721
Only the original user who
owns the data can decrypt it.

90
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,490
This is by design
and helps iCloud

91
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,192
maintain a high level
of security and privacy

92
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,163
and ensures
that sensitive data stays safe.

93
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:27,234
Next, I'll show you how
to share zones in the Console.

94
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,302
CloudKit sharing is a safe way

95
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,006
to securely share records
between users of your app.

96
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,808
This is sharing done securely,

97
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,576
using permissions
that allow your app

98
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,914
to determine a participant's
read and write access.

99
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,883
Participant access
is further controlled

100
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,888
by defining shares
as public or private.

101
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:52,192
Zone sharing works by applying
rules to every record in a zone.

102
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,861
A shared zone
has a CloudKit share record

103
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,430
that contains the options
for accessing each record

104
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,599
in the zone.

105
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,603
Shared zones cannot have
existing shared records.

106
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,239
The standard public
and private zone sharing options

107
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,210
are supported by shared zones.

108
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,113
A public shared zone
makes every record visible

109
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,615
to everyone who has
the share code.

110
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,019
Anyone with the short share code
can join this share.

111
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,688
This is ideal for records
that should be easy to share

112
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,458
between users
without strict access control.

113
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,595
Private shared zones have
an additional layer of security

114
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,897
because members must be
in the participant list

115
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,667
to join the share.

116
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,036
CloudKit Console
has several new tools

117
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,004
for creating and viewing
zone shares,

118
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,240
to help you
better understand shared zones

119
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,843
and work with them during
development and production.

120
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,582
Let's create a zone share now
so you can learn how it works.

121
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,185
Navigate to Zones, then select
a zone that you want to share.

122
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,588
Click the Configure zone
wide sharing... button

123
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,356
in the details view.

124
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,091
This shows a form
that lets you decide

125
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,461
if you want a public
or private share.

126
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,964
Public zones have
an additional permission option

127
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,300
for creating read-only
or read/write shares.

128
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,402
For private shares,
the permissions are defined

129
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,504
at a participant level.

130
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,507
I'm going to create
a private share, like this.

131
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,145
Once the zone is shared,
you will see a short unique ID

132
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,950
that can be sent to participants
to join the share.

133
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,152
Shared zones can be joined
in the console

134
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,555
by using the Accept Shared
Record menu option

135
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,057
found in the Records page.

136
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,859
Now any record created
in this zone

137
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,996
will be automatically shared.

138
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,765
Now that you've seen these
updates to CloudKit Console,

139
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,269
go and tidy up your container
lists by hiding containers,

140
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,938
try out Act As iCloud
so you can see records

141
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,341
with different iCloud accounts,
and try out zone sharing

142
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,945
for easier sharing
of multiple records.

143
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,581
We hope these tools
enable you to better understand

144
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,517
your schema,
debug issues in your apps,

145
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,187
and make CloudKit
a little easier to work with.

146
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,623
Thanks, and have a great WWDC.
