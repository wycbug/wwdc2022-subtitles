[upbeat music]

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,678
- Hello, I'm Josh
and I'm a software engineer

3
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,714
on the Apple Business Essentials team.

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,983
As a small business,
you may find yourself managing

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,785
an increasing number of devices
as your team expands.

6
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,421
The IT demands that come with this
can be a lot to take on,

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,391
taking time away
from doing what you do best.

8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,693
Apple Business Essentials makes this easy

9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,963
with a subscription that seamlessly
brings together device management,

10
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,733
24/7 support, and cloud storage

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,302
so your small business can manage
every employee's iPhone,

12
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,639
iPad and Mac every step of the way.

13
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,175
And for your employees, it's simple.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,777
All they need to do is sign in
with a Managed Apple ID,

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,547
and their devices are set up
with Apple Business Essentials.

16
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,349
Once they're signed in,

17
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,052
devices are automatically configured
with the settings they need,

18
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,290
including critical security settings
like FileVault and passcode policies

19
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,960
as well as all of the apps
they need to be productive.

20
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,563
Plus, the iCloud storage to store,
collaborate on,

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,132
and share documents in iCloud Drive.

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,869
They can even use iCloud backups
for their iPhones and iPads.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:14,007
When something goes wrong, AppleCare+
for Business Essentials is there to help.

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,743
Repair credits are shared
across the entire organization

25
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:20,380
and can be used for any device
under a plan with coverage.

26
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,849
In fact, Apple Business Essentials

27
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,283
helps you with every step

28
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,118
of the device lifecycle.

29
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,854
In this session, we'll explore the ways

30
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,255
you can take advantage of

31
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,191
everything the subscription has to offer.

32
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:35,829
We'll review the first step: getting
an account in Apple Business Manager.

33
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,266
We'll start a new Apple Business
Essentials subscription,

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,401
add settings and apps,

35
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,504
and explore how the experience
looks for employees

36
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,339
as they enroll their devices.

37
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,974
Let's get started.

38
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,879
Apple Business Essentials exists inside
of Apple Business Manager

39
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,782
where you manage devices,
add users, and purchase apps.

40
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,453
To subscribe to Apple Business Essentials
as your device management solution,

41
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,055
you first need an
Apple Business Manager account.

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,760
Sign up by visiting business.apple.com

43
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,629
and entering your company name,

44
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,731
DUNS number, and contact information.

45
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,702
Once you have an account,
the next step is to add users.

46
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,006
You add individual users by
manually entering their information

47
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,076
or sync an existing list of users
from a Microsoft Azure Directory

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,411
or Google Workspace.

49
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,381
Many of your users share common needs,

50
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,616
like a sales department or field workers,

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,519
so you want them to get
the same settings and apps.

52
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:36,223
To prepare for this, make user groups
with the users you just created.

53
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,927
And save time using 'smart user groups'

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,230
which automatically creates groups
based on common attributes

55
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,400
like division, location, and role.

56
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,036
Now that I have
my Apple Business Manager account

57
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,672
and I've set up some users and groups,

58
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,308
I'm ready to enroll
in Apple Business Essentials.

59
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,244
Let's go to the Mac;
here's Apple Business Manager.

60
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:03,150
I find Subscription in the sidebar
and start a free trial .

61
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,820
I need to choose whether this is
an employee plan or a device plan.

62
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:11,225
Employee plans are just that--
plans for devices used by my employees.

63
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:15,062
Device plans are also available for things
like conference room devices,

64
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,497
kiosks, loaners, or other cases

65
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,300
where the device is not assigned
to a specific employee.

66
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:25,339
Next is the number of devices
per employee, either just 1 or up to 3.

67
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,808
I'm setting up a plan for my sales team.

68
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,078
I know they're on the road frequently
and usually have a work MacBook

69
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,013
as well as an iPhone and iPad,

70
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,383
so I'll set them up
with a three-device plan.

71
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,452
Next, storage.

72
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:42,456
With the subscription, my employees get
an iCloud account dedicated for work

73
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,526
so they can access their files
and folders across their devices.

74
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,463
I'll stick with 200 GB for now;
this should be plenty to start with.

75
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,665
But if my team's needs
change in the future,

76
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,600
I can update it at any time.

77
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,571
Last, I select AppleCare+
for Business Essentials for repair,

78
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,742
service and support; perfect for
my sales staff who are out in the field.

79
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,980
Next, I add user groups
and individual users.

80
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:11,318
Let's search for the sales team
and add them to this plan.

81
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,922
I've already entered
my payment information.

82
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,992
I review the pricing...

83
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,994
and add the plan.

84
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,964
As my business grows,
having multiple plans lets me cover

85
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,366
all the unique needs
of my employees and devices,

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,571
and when I make changes at any time,
I'll only pay for what I use.

87
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,806
My Apple Business Manager view
updates to reflect

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,576
that I'm subscribed to
Apple Business Essentials

89
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,545
and I now see Settings
and Collections in the sidebar.

90
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,116
Settings provides a list of configurations
I automatically push to a managed device.

91
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,287
Apps provides a list of apps to purchase
for my users to download on their devices

92
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,189
with the Essentials app.

93
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:53,894
Collections are a group of Settings
and Apps that I assign to users or groups.

94
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,363
We'll get started
by exploring the settings.

95
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,267
The Essentials category brings together
the settings I'm most likely to use.

96
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,270
But I have a number of options here,
so let's understand what they are

97
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,506
and then add the ones I need.

98
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,377
The security tab brings together
all your critical security settings

99
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,113
to one place so they're easy to configure.

100
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,916
For my iOS devices,
I want a password setting.

101
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,451
I'll do that shortly.

102
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,554
For my macOS devices,
I add the FileVault setting

103
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,190
to ensure my employee's Macs
encrypt their data.

104
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,059
I turn on Application Layer Firewall
to protect against threats

105
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,530
from incoming network traffic
to untrusted apps.

106
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:33,567
I turn on Gatekeeper to prevent
untrusted apps from running altogether.

107
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,405
Moving on to the network category,
I configure my devices with AirPrint

108
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,308
to automatically connect to my printers
and use the Wi-Fi setting

109
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,511
to configure trusted networks
so they're available automatically

110
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,613
when the user signs in to their device.

111
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,250
Personalization provides
additional settings that I can use

112
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,986
to customize the experience
for the devices in my fleet.

113
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,592
For example, I use conference room display
to restrict my apple TVs to airplay only.

114
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,894
For my macOS devices,
the login Window setting

115
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,163
allows me to display a message
on the login window,

116
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,066
which is great for showing things
like support email addresses

117
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,502
or phone numbers.

118
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,506
Let's go back to the essentials category
to add a few of these settings.

119
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,244
We'll create a new configured setting
and name it Password Policy.

120
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,520
The check boxes are on
for both macOS and iOS,

121
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,556
and let's leave on the switch on
for "password and security options"

122
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,693
to require my users
to create a strong password.

123
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,596
I select the "no" option
for "allow simple passwords"

124
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,398
to require my employees to choose
at least one special character

125
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,200
as part of their password,

126
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,237
and 'yes' for
"require alpha numeric password"

127
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,740
requires at least one letter and number
for their password.

128
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,408
Let's save this setting.

129
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,146
And here it is, added to my settings list.

130
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,517
Next, I configure Wi-Fi passwords
so my employees' devices

131
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,552
automatically join a known Wi-Fi network.

132
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,555
I'll name this setting
BetterBag Secure Wi-Fi.

133
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,495
I enter my company's Wi-Fi name...
and password.

134
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,101
I leave the "network visibility"
as visible,

135
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,304
leave "auto join" as "yes" and save.

136
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,008
Let's move on to apps.

137
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,014
The Apps page is where I get
apps, both paid and free,

138
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,951
that my users then install with
the Essentials app on their device.

139
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,321
Here I have the apps and books available
from the Apple App Store

140
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,889
as well as any Custom Apps

141
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,892
that have been made available
specifically for me to purchase.

142
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,596
I'd like all my users to have the Pages
app for iOS available to install,

143
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,499
so let's search for and get Pages.

144
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:54,308
When my users install Pages from the
Essentials app, the app is managed,

145
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,643
which means updates happen automatically,

146
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:00,214
and the app will be uninstalled
if the user signs out of the device.

147
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,950
I assign the app to my office.

148
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:10,157
I need 4 licenses, and I confirm
the price--free, in this case.

149
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,593
Let's get the licenses for the app.

150
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,265
Now that I have settings configured
and apps purchased,

151
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,368
let's group them together
into a Collection.

152
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:25,572
A Collection applies a combination of
settings and apps to users and groups.

153
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,242
This ensures that employees' devices
are configured correctly

154
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,143
and they have access
to the apps that they need

155
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,079
as soon as they sign in to their devices.

156
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:36,717
I create a new Collection
for my sales team and name it Sales.

157
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,988
I add apps to my collection
in the apps tab.

158
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,589
Let's add Pages.

159
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,129
Similarly, I add settings to
my collection in the settings tab.

160
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:55,235
Let's search for and add the Wi-Fi

161
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,870
and password policy settings.

162
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,442
Finally, I add my Sales team to
this collection in the User Groups tab.

163
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,815
I just search for the Sales User group
and add it.

164
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:15,422
Let's save, and I can now see
my newly created collection.

165
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:20,294
Okay. I have apps and settings,
and I've assigned them to my employees.

166
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,864
Now, I need to give the employees
a way to sign in to their devices.

167
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,602
In the User list,
let's find one of my employees,

168
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,003
Eliza...

169
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,941
And create a Managed Apple ID for her.

170
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,746
Either I download a file with
the user name and temporary password

171
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,884
or send Eliza an email with her
Managed Apple ID credentials directly.

172
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,858
Let's explore what this looks like
from Eliza's perspective.

173
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,794
She has a company iPad
and a personal iPhone.

174
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,831
She uses her Managed Apple ID
we created to enroll both devices.

175
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,100
Let's start with the company-owned iPad.

176
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,238
Because this iPad
was purchased specifically

177
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,374
for my organization through Apple
or an authorized reseller,

178
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,645
Eliza gets the Work sign-in
right when she sets up her device.

179
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,948
She enters the username and
password from the email I sent her.

180
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,784
Upon completing setup,

181
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,154
the device automatically joins the office
Wi-Fi network that I've set up

182
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,923
and the Essentials app is installed.

183
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,694
Next, she sets up her personal iPhone.

184
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,631
This device is already signed in
with her personal Apple ID

185
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,567
and has all of her personal apps and data.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,135
With Apple Business Essentials,

187
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,138
Eliza can sign in to
her work account separately.

188
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:41,041
She goes to the settings app,
selects general,

189
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,710
VPN and Device Management,

190
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,246
and sign in with a work or school account.

191
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,650
Then she enters her username and password.

192
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,152
Now her iPhone is signed into
both her personal account

193
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,721
and her Apple Business Essentials account.

194
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,724
The best part is that these are
crytographically separated,

195
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,294
meaning her personal data stays private

196
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,397
while her work data
remains managed and secure.

197
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,568
Once enrolled,
Eliza has all the settings

198
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,939
automatically deployed to her device,
and the Essentials app is downloaded.

199
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,076
She uses it to install all the apps
I've assigned to her.

200
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,047
On the devices tab,
she has all her devices

201
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,682
and the Apple Support button.

202
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,951
If something goes wrong
with one of her devices,

203
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,854
she initiates a repair request
from inside the Essentials app

204
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,356
with the "Visit Apple Support" button.

205
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,492
Once approved, she requests
a repair technician to come to her

206
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,697
or she brings the device to an
Apple Authorized Service Provider.

207
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,502
I see the status in Service and Support,
where I approve or deny the request.

208
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,273
With Apple Business Essentials,
as your needs change,

209
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,643
you go back and revisit
your apps and settings.

210
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:53,313
The changes you make are automatically
pushed to your employees' devices.

211
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:58,285
If a device is lost or needs to be
re-provisioned, you select the device,

212
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,289
and either "sign out user",
"lock device" or "erase,"

213
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,325
and the action is taken on the device.

214
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,095
And that employee replacing
or upgrading their device

215
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,198
just needs to sign in to a new device
with their Managed Apple ID

216
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,201
to access their apps,
settings, and work data in iCloud.

217
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,771
Let's wrap up.

218
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,541
We reviewed how to get set up
in Apple Business Manager.

219
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,676
We subscribed
to Apple Business Essentials,

220
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,445
making a few key decisions along the way.

221
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,314
We added settings and apps
to collections

222
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,917
which we assigned
to a user group of employees

223
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,488
and explored how the experience
looks for employees on their devices.

224
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,792
Apple Business Essentials, currently
available to U.S.-based small businesses,

225
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,763
lets you get back to doing
what you do best, faster.

226
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,066
It's simple to manage the entire life of
your employees' devices

227
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,436
with easy set up and onboarding,
security and privacy,

228
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,339
storage and backup, support and repair,

229
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,009
and updates
with one flexible subscription.

230
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,645
