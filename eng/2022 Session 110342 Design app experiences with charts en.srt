Nicholas: Hi.
I’m Nicholas Felton,

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,047
a designer
on the Human Interface team.

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,718
Today I’ll be talking about how to build
great app experiences using charts.

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,321
Charts are a great way to communicate
complex information.

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,057
We use them throughout Apple
to enhance our products.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,962
Health uses charts to help us understand
our bodies,

8
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,965
Fitness inspires us
to stay active with charts,

9
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,401
and Weather displays charts
to help us plan our day.

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,105
We know that developers love them as well,

11
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,341
and we see inspiring examples
in every category.

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,545
From the detailed workout analysis
in Strava

13
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,014
to the playful progress charts
in Duolingo.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,350
Charts can be found everywhere, and when
well-designed,

15
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,019
can reveal subtleties in data

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,555
that you cannot communicate easily
through text.

17
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,091
In addition to their utility, charts
are also an opportunity

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,828
to support the personality of your app
and add visual interest to your UI.

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,166
To demonstrate how an app can be enhanced
with charts,

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,435
let’s look at one made
for the owner of a food truck

21
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,736
selling pancakes.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,340
The app currently has a tab
for entering orders,

23
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,543
and another for viewing
recent transactions.

24
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,879
This works fine for keeping track
of sales,

25
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,149
but this information could be
much more useful.

26
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,718
This year, we’re introducing Swift Charts.

27
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,156
With this framework, making charts
for Apple devices has never been easier.

28
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,426
In the following sections, I will share
the principles we follow

29
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,962
when designing experiences
with charts at Apple.

30
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,065
We will apply these concepts to create
wireframes

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,068
for a more informative version
of the food truck app.

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,971
In order to build a great experience
with charts,

33
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,906
we should consider three things:

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,008
when to use charts,

35
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,743
how to use them,

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,614
and how they relate to each other
in a chart design system.

37
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,683
Let’s begin by discussing
when to use charts in an app.

38
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,586
Here are some common cases
where a chart can elevate

39
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,522
the information being presented:

40
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,691
When showing historical
or predicted values,

41
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,394
a chart can vividly demonstrate
changes in data.

42
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,466
By visualizing a portion of a whole,
we can use charts to show the state

43
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,737
of something that is completing,
progressing towards a goal, or emptying.

44
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:22,676
When comparing items or categories, we can
easily evaluate their values with charts.

45
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,713
To decide whether any
of these approaches

46
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,684
are appropriate for your app,
consider what the experience needs first.

47
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,954
How will a chart support
the core goals of your app?

48
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,224
When used correctly, charts provide focus.

49
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,993
As an app creator,
there are many things you could visualize,

50
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,496
but only the most important information
should become a chart.

51
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,366
For someone using an app,
charts are a strong signal.

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,003
They direct attention to the information
you want them to understand.

53
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,273
The goal of the food truck app
is to improve the operation

54
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,175
of the businesses using it.

55
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,412
If we can use charts to turn
a list of transactions

56
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,180
into actionable information,

57
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:04,051
food truck owners
will welcome the improvement.

58
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:08,155
Here is some key information that we know
will be useful to food truck owners:

59
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,957
viewing recent sales,

60
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,825
understanding what items are popular,

61
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,862
and knowing the best location
to visit each day.

62
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,433
As you consider your app, remember
that charts should direct attention

63
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:23,203
and provide focus to the most
important information in your experience.

64
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,273
Now that we’ve established
what we want to communicate,

65
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,809
let’s look
at how to achieve this using charts.

66
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,613
To illustrate recent sales,
a chart showing change over time

67
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,981
will be appropriate.

68
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,951
One way of doing this is to use
a bar chart showing sales totals

69
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,354
for each of the last 30 days.

70
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,790
We will add axis labels soon,
but first, it needs a description

71
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,626
to tell someone what the chart represents.

72
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:51,365
A title like "Sales in the Past 30 Days"
labels the elements of the chart

73
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,534
but doesn’t communicate anything more.

74
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,736
How can we summarize
the information being shown?

75
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,741
A chart should be accompanied by text
that describes the chart contents.

76
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,044
If read in isolation,
it should be informative.

77
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,848
Adding the total number of pancakes sold
transforms the title

78
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,217
into a self-contained description.

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,554
Now someone can quickly gather
key information from the text,

80
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,689
while the chart
provides supporting details.

81
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,327
When a chart is not straightforward,
using a complete sentence

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,696
for the description can make
it easier to understand.

83
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,803
For example: "Sales in the past 30 days
totaled 1,234 pancakes."

84
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,708
Another way of framing the chart
is to interpret the data.

85
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,645
For example: "Sales for the past 30
days are up 12%,

86
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,815
totaling 1,234 pancakes."

87
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,684
This will help someone understand

88
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,954
if the level of recent sales
is high or low

89
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,223
or if it is increasing or decreasing.

90
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,226
This technique can make
a description more meaningful,

91
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,194
particularly when the data is unfamiliar.

92
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,765
Each of these approaches is
a good way of describing a chart,

93
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,369
but this overview is just one way
of explaining our sales data.

94
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,405
What else can we do
to illuminate these transactions?

95
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,910
Try to incorporate details
from other perspectives.

96
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,280
It’s important to summarize your data,
but when we find ways

97
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,450
to elevate categories or highlight
individual records,

98
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,485
a chart becomes multi-dimensional.

99
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,321
Here are some additional perspectives
to consider:

100
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:25,192
At a macro level, we look for ways to
describe the entire data set,

101
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,795
like a total, or average value.

102
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,533
At a medium scale,
we look at sub-sets of data.

103
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,403
These might be time-based,
like comparing weekdays to weekends

104
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,607
or investigating changes
related to the time of day.

105
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,777
Other approaches might categorize
sales by the style of pancake

106
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,746
or the city where they were sold.

107
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,651
At the micro level,
we focus on individual data points.

108
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:55,055
The last transaction or largest sale
are important small-scale details

109
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,957
you may want to call out in your charts.

110
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,629
The more carefully you observe a data set,
the more detail will emerge.

111
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,766
Some of the perspectives
we’ve identified could be useful

112
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,503
to food truck owners planning
their inventory or sales locations.

113
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,940
It would be useful to augment
the recent sales chart

114
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,842
with some of these details.

115
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,146
To do this, we can use a set
of tappable rows under the chart.

116
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,416
Each row provides a summary statistic,
and when tapped,

117
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,384
the chart is updated to match.

118
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,855
We can show the daily average value

119
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:33,160
or the difference between weekday
and weekend sales

120
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,195
or the best sales day.

121
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,665
These overlays can be extremely useful,
but this amount of information

122
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,068
requires a large surface
to work effectively.

123
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:46,206
As the functionality of a chart increases,
so will its size.

124
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,276
Smaller charts tend to be static.

125
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,945
Examples include Watch complications,

126
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,015
the repeating thumbnail charts
in Stocks,

127
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,817
and the trend platters in Health.

128
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,953
Static charts rarely exist in isolation.

129
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:04,491
They tend to provide a preview
of a larger chart in another view.

130
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,861
As they are generally small,
static charts don’t require grid lines,

131
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,163
labels, or interactivity,

132
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:14,334
since they create the expectation
that additional detail is just a tap away.

133
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,803
Interactive charts tend to be larger,

134
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,572
and include much more detail,

135
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,542
like the charts in Stocks and in Health.

136
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,479
An interactive chart will typically be
the width of your view,

137
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,880
but not full-height.

138
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:31,451
You should include axis lines and labels
so that values can be estimated.

139
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:36,990
Interactivity is recommended at this size
for accessing precise values

140
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,492
in the chart

141
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:43,730
and the ability to change the time range
or time scope will aid exploration.

142
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:49,770
The largest and most interactive charts
allow for deep investigation of data

143
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,339
and require the most vertical space.

144
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,875
As charts become more powerful,
it’s important

145
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,845
to introduce
additional functionality gradually.

146
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,781
You should progressively reveal
chart complexity

147
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,083
so that someone can choose
the level of information

148
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,718
that matches their interest.

149
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,691
Use a small static chart higher
in the navigation hierarchy

150
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,493
to offer a path to expanded versions
of the chart.

151
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,898
When you create a link
between two versions of the same chart,

152
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,234
that progression should maintain
continuity

153
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,403
by preserving values, context and state.

154
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,542
Keep in mind that when someone
expresses interest in a chart,

155
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,045
they want to see more of what
they have already seen.

156
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,148
This means that a chart
should retain its shape

157
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,252
and any numbers apparent
in an earlier view should be preserved.

158
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,056
You can add information,
but showing something different

159
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,158
can be frustrating or disorienting.

160
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:50,097
While we’re considering the functionality
of different sized charts,

161
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,899
let’s revisit our food truck app

162
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,568
to determine where our planned charts
will go.

163
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:58,805
We currently have two tabs,
one dedicated to placing orders,

164
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,241
and a second that shows the sales history.

165
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,610
These records
are what we will be visualizing,

166
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,413
so it makes sense to adapt
this view to include our charts.

167
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:11,084
Let’s clear the tab by moving
the sales to a separate view

168
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,221
behind a "View all sales"
navigational element.

169
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,657
We now have a prominent canvas
for our charts.

170
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,560
As a result,
it’s appropriate to use a static chart

171
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,930
that lets someone scan the data
and decide whether they want to see more.

172
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,368
Here’s the static chart
showing recent sales.

173
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,606
Tapping the platter
leads to an expanded interactive chart.

174
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,576
We now have
a complete recent sales experience.

175
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,679
This interactive chart
will support detailed analysis

176
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:42,216
with 30-day and 1-year views,
touch states,

177
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,951
and tappable summary statistics.

178
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,857
As you’re working on your app,
remember that charts need descriptions

179
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,459
to inform the contents
and provide a key takeaway,

180
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:56,763
the details in your data can add richness
to your charts,

181
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,000
and that you should progressively reveal
chart complexity within your app.

182
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,537
Now let’s look at chart design systems.

183
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,839
When your app includes
more than one chart,

184
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,008
you’ve created a chart design system.

185
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,245
Here are some things to remember
when planning multiple charts:

186
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,915
Use familiar forms.

187
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,452
Start with common chart styles
to aid comprehension.

188
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,988
If someone has
already used a similar chart,

189
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,991
they will be more likely
to understand yours.

190
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:29,596
Bar charts and line charts are forms
that many people encounter and use daily,

191
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,499
while a scatter plot
is less common and may require

192
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,936
extra guidance to ensure that
it is interpreted correctly.

193
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,474
If you want to do something unique,
it should be introduced clearly,

194
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,411
as demonstrated here
in the onboarding flow for Activity.

195
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,181
After the activity rings are introduced,

196
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:54,121
they are split apart to show the move,
exercise, and stand components.

197
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,826
Ideally, a new form is central
to your app, not supplementary.

198
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,763
The prominence you give a novel chart
will encourage people

199
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,398
to explore and understand it.

200
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,035
When creating supporting charts,

201
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,803
familiar forms are more important,

202
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,872
as they will not be given
as much prominence.

203
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,443
Differences matter,
and the variations between charts

204
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,378
are a signal that something has changed.

205
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:24,051
To demonstrate this, let’s start
with two copies of our recent sales chart.

206
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:28,288
I’ll slowly update the chart on the right
to communicate different information,

207
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:32,893
and we'll show how the design evolves
to signal these distinctions.

208
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,663
First, I’ll change the time scope
of the chart on the right.

209
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,602
Rather than showing recent sales,
it now shows sales for the last 12 months.

210
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:47,140
I have changed the description and updated
the chart to show 12 months of data.

211
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,844
Minimal changes
are required for this modification.

212
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,515
If I want to change the type of data
being displayed in the right-hand chart,

213
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,451
it may not be sufficient
to only change the description.

214
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,721
Noticing this change in text
could be easily missed,

215
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,757
so an additional change is necessary.

216
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,094
Giving each of these charts
a distinct color helps.

217
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,631
Now it is easier to notice
that these charts are unique.

218
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,133
Creating this difference
makes it more likely

219
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,469
that someone will now read
the description.

220
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,474
Finally, I want to update the chart
on the right

221
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:24,545
to show the range of daily sales
for each of past 12 months.

222
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,214
This requires both a change
to the description

223
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,183
and the way that the data is represented.

224
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,220
To underscore
the significance of this change,

225
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,889
modifying the styling
of the bars is appropriate.

226
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:39,860
The chart on the right
now conveys a different subject,

227
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,429
different time range,
and different metrics.

228
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,631
The design is purposefully distinct

229
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,234
to ensure that these differences
will be noticed.

230
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,370
We can apply these principles
to the two other charts

231
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:51,939
we need for our food truck app.

232
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,643
To compliment the recent sales,
I’d like to add another chart

233
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,213
that shows
the most popular style of pancake.

234
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:04,051
One way of showing the most popular style
is to compare the relative sales level

235
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,786
for each pancake.

236
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,056
Since we are interested
in the last 30 days as a whole,

237
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,259
we only need one bar to compare
the popularity of styles.

238
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:17,197
If I separate the bars,
I can compare their sizes more clearly,

239
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,900
but this starts to look
like a time series chart again.

240
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,605
By making the bars horizontal,
I can accentuate the difference

241
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,940
between this chart
and the recent sales chart.

242
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:32,012
The horizontal orientation also
lets me make the bars longer

243
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,848
without needing to make the platter
on the sales tab taller.

244
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:40,320
In this preview platter, I’ve omitted
labels to focus only on the top style.

245
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:46,560
In the detail view, each bar is labeled,
and the relative values are visible.

246
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,197
For our final chart,
we would like to show sales

247
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,066
in the two cities where the truck operates
for each day of the week.

248
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,703
For this, we will need to do
something a bit specialized.

249
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:01,008
The context for this chart
is sales by day of the week.

250
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,977
In this case, we want to look
at each day independently.

251
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,548
Here are the average daily sales
for each day of the week

252
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,149
over the past 30 days.

253
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,453
As the food truck operates
in both Cupertino and San Francisco,

254
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:17,457
we need to split these bars
to represent each location.

255
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:22,596
Finally, let’s convert these bars
into lines to focus on the daily changes.

256
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,898
I’ve added this chart to the sales tab

257
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,035
and included a description
to summarize the data.

258
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,038
In this case, the best sales day
over the past 30 days

259
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,674
was Sunday in San Francisco.

260
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,412
The subsequent detail page
is the last chart we will add to the app.

261
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,948
It provides additional interactivity
and details,

262
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,183
including keys for the two lines.

263
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,187
We’ve now sketched out the set of charts
we plan to add

264
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,289
to the pancake food truck app.

265
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,626
Using charts to show recent sales,
popular items,

266
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,294
and top days and locations

267
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,030
will dramatically improve
the utility of this app.

268
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:02,736
As you work on your app, remember
to use familiar chart forms

269
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,738
to assist comprehension

270
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,674
and intentionally create differences
between your charts

271
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,877
to improve their interpretation.

272
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,180
In this talk,
we discussed when to use charts,

273
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,684
how to use them, and how they relate
to each other in a chart design system.

274
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,954
Applying these principles will help you
communicate data in your app

275
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,690
with more clarity and appeal.

276
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,993
To continue learning about chart design,

277
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,929
you can watch "Design an Effective Chart,"

278
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,731
or for an introduction to Swift Charts,

279
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,165
watch "Hello Swift Charts."
