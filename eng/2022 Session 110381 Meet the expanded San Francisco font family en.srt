Hi, my name is Vincenzo,

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,048
and I'm a type designer
on the Apple Design Team.

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,185
I'm part of the group responsible
for the design and expansion

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,255
of many of the font families
used in our platforms.

6
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,558
We focus on making functional
and expressive fonts

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,594
that are essential
in enabling great typography.

8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,531
I'm here to share some awesome
updates on San Francisco

9
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,934
and tell you about all the latest
additions to the system fonts.

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,604
We'll start with an overview
of the San Francisco family of fonts.

11
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,040
I'll take you through
the various available families,

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,776
styles, and Optical Sizes.

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,079
Then I'll introduce
the new width styles in SF Pro:

14
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,515
Condensed, Compressed, and Expanded.

15
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,219
I'll also share a few examples
of how and why to choose these styles

16
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,855
while designing User Interfaces.

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,224
And to wrap up,
I'll talk about how we're bringing

18
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,928
many of the features of San Francisco
to other writing systems,

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,531
introducing SF Arabic
and SF Arabic Rounded.

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,200
Let's jump right in,

21
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,303
starting with a quick overview
of San Francisco.

22
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:12,706
San Francisco is a functional
and versatile family of fonts

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,009
designed by Apple
and used throughout our platforms.

24
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,612
Over the years San Francisco
has grown in parallel

25
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,248
with an eco-system of products
and experiences,

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,417
providing new styles and families

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,820
capable of adapting
to the various needs of UI design.

28
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:30,057
Today San Francisco includes
different font families

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,492
which share a common visual language

30
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:36,029
but with unique features designed
specifically for different environments

31
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,533
and applications,
such as SF Pro and SF Pro Rounded,

32
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,669
the main system fonts
used in many of our platforms,

33
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:47,107
like iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,643
SF Compact and SF Compact Rounded,

35
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:55,148
a variation of San Francisco optimized
for narrow columns and small point sizes,

36
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,252
also the default system fonts in watchOS.

37
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,221
And SF Mono,
the monospaced SF:

38
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,626
used in coding environments
like Xcode and Swift Playgrounds.

39
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,363
All of these font families, together,
provide great functionality

40
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,031
and range of expression

41
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,968
that allows text to be rendered
in a variety of contexts.

42
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,872
Most SF families come with
a comprehensive palette of weights,

43
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,542
spanning from Ultralight to Black,

44
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,610
providing enough stylistic variation

45
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,147
to create emphasis
and typographic hierarchies.

46
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,851
Also, most of the font families come
with Optical Sizes,

47
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,221
allowing the fonts to automatically adjust
certain design features

48
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,024
based on the point size of text.

49
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:41,895
For example, moving the dot on top of
the "i" further away from the base shape,

50
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:45,899
or opening up
the apertures of certain glyphs,

51
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:50,671
as well as progressively tracking out text
at smaller point sizes.

52
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:55,342
All of these adjustments optimize
the fonts generating unique designs

53
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,744
to fit different point sizes,

54
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,681
for both Display and Text typesetting,

55
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:05,485
typographic terms used in reference
to Large and Small text.

56
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,223
The San Francisco fonts offer control
and flexibility

57
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:14,928
to render clear and legible interfaces
consistently across all Apple platforms.

58
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,197
These are some of the highlights of SF,

59
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,732
but there's so much more.

60
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,135
If you want to dive deeper
into Optical Sizes, Variable fonts,

61
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,671
and Dynamic Type,
I encourage you to check out

62
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,877
Loïc and Jiang's session "The details
of UI typography" from WWDC 2020.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,380
Now, today we're going to be focusing
on SF Pro,

64
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,084
which is already an incredible tool
to design User Interfaces.

65
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:41,788
However, while weights and optical sizes
already cover many designers' needs,

66
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,491
we identified a set of specific tasks

67
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,928
that couldn't be fulfilled by
just Weight and Optical axes.

68
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,297
For instance, in the Photos app,

69
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,368
where we expanded the stylistic variations
of the Titles in Memories.

70
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,106
Or in News, where SF serves
as the editorial voice in headlines,

71
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,376
with expressive
and space-efficient styles.

72
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,246
And lastly, in Maps,
where providing more stylistic options

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,383
increased typographic contrast
and legibility.

74
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,753
So we further expanded
the capabilities of SF

75
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,255
by designing a new axis.

76
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,325
With Weights and Optical Sizes
already available,

77
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,896
adding a Width axis was the natural
evolution of SF:

78
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,034
Joining the Regular Width
we have three more styles:

79
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,237
Condensed,
narrow and space-efficient;

80
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,474
Compressed, the most compact
style currently available in SF;

81
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:39,213
and last but not least, on
the other end of the spectrum, Expanded.

82
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,982
These are all the new available Widths
in SF,

83
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,117
which in combination with all the Weights,

84
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,687
add a tremendous amount of options,

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,556
bringing a whole set of new voices
and functionalities

86
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,626
to accommodate a broad range
of applications.

87
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,864
Some of these styles are more neutral;
others are more expressive.

88
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,832
Every style is functional
in its own right,

89
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:03,270
but depending on the design intent,
some will perform better than others.

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,839
There are no absolute rules in typography,

91
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,076
but you can expect the styles that
gravitate towards the center

92
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,713
of the stylistic map of SF
to have a more neutral voice,

93
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,449
while the styles
around the perimeter of the map,

94
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,552
which feature more extreme Weight
and Width proportions,

95
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,722
to be more expressive,
have a stronger voice,

96
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,592
attributes that can be useful
if you want to draw people's attention

97
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,761
towards a certain area of the UI

98
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,497
or strengthen a typographic hierarchy.

99
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,101
Let's explore the shared and unique
features of these styles

100
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,537
and learn how to make
more informed decisions

101
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,107
during the process of choosing
and pairing fonts.

102
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,711
First things first, all the styles provide
the same language support

103
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,181
and can be used to typeset
most of the languages

104
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:51,285
which use the Latin script,
from English to Vietnamese.

105
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:56,290
But also Greek and languages
based on the Cyrillic writing system.

106
00:05:56,323 --> 00:06:01,261
Something else that all the styles
have in common is the vertical proportions

107
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:06,466
so that they can be used without any
visual scale discrepancies across Weight.

108
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,538
A feature that makes swapping
or mixing fonts predictable and easy,

109
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:16,677
so when using different Width styles,
the focus is solely on the Width itself.

110
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,214
In fact, only the horizontal proportions
of the glyphs change

111
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,083
and of course, as a byproduct,
the line length.

112
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,120
The progressively narrower proportions
highlight a defining aspect

113
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,156
that differs between the styles,

114
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,826
which is the relationship between
the stem thickness of each style, which–

115
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,597
albeit some optical adjustments–
remains fairly consistent.

116
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,199
Instead, the negative area
inside the glyphs,

117
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,235
which has a much more dramatic shift,

118
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:45,305
becomes much tighter or wider
depending on the Width style.

119
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,042
This balance has stylistic
and functional implications

120
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,347
in regards to the legibility of a font,
but also the personality.

121
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,017
So here are some considerations
regarding each style.

122
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,554
I'm sure it doesn't come as a surprise
that the Regular Width

123
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,757
is the most ubiquitous
and versatile style.

124
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,794
It features standard proportions,
making text easy to read.

125
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:11,598
You can stick to the Regular Width
when the functionalities offered

126
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,034
by the other Widths are not necessary.

127
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,038
Condensed, while looking narrower
compared to the Regular style,

128
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,274
still features a comfortable Width,

129
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:25,045
allowing itself to be used to fit
more text without being overly present.

130
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,615
Compressed features
very dense proportions,

131
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,320
with flat-sided shapes, which allow
the design to become much tighter,

132
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,589
making it very space-efficient

133
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,426
but also graphical and
ideal as a Display style.

134
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,528
And lastly, Expanded,

135
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,931
with a striking loose and open appearance

136
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,133
that can find use in Display typesetting

137
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,269
but also smaller labels,
and secondary content.

138
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,539
We can see them in action,
typesetting the same text

139
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,842
using the same Weight
but different Widths,

140
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:59,246
calls attention to one of the most obvious
use cases for these new styles,

141
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,748
which is space-efficiency.

142
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:06,954
In fact, we can notice how tighter
or wider SF looks at the same point size.

143
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,657
But also how we can typeset
Condensed or Compressed much larger

144
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,860
while still fitting in
the same line length,

145
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,897
which is very useful when
dealing with titles and headlines.

146
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,700
But it's not only about Display sizes.

147
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:24,338
In fact, the Width styles can
help control longer passages of text,

148
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,708
providing the ability
to fit more characters per line,

149
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,745
achieving a more ideal and comfortable
reading experience for narrow columns.

150
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,348
or just shortening
or lengthening a paragraph,

151
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,518
for filling or freeing space in a layout.

152
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,622
However, this example highlights
also how the Compressed style,

153
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,458
while still functional
for small single lines,

154
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,896
might be too tight for longer
passages of text, like you see here.

155
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:54,201
So always consider legibility
when opting for a non-Regular Width.

156
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,104
Now that we've seen the main features
of these new styles,

157
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,907
let me walk you through a few examples
of how they've helped us

158
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,676
improve and expand
the typography in our apps.

159
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,613
Let's start with Photos,
where the new range of Widths,

160
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,650
joined other styles
bringing even more visual interest

161
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,852
in the Titles of Memories

162
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,155
with text treatments that celebrate
and elevate the content

163
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,224
from the rest of the UI.

164
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,994
Taking a closer look,
we can see that the difference in scale

165
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:24,464
takes care of establishing
the typographic hierarchy,

166
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,101
telling us clearly
which is the primary piece of information

167
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:31,238
and which is the secondary.

168
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:35,542
Two contrasting Width styles,
like Compressed and Expanded,

169
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:40,080
take on the job of making the text
more unique and visually impactful.

170
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:44,418
Pairing the wide and condensed styles
of SF with different weights

171
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:48,322
can allow for a near-endless variety
of font pairings.

172
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,458
For instance, you can decide
to stick to just one Width style–

173
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,193
Expanded in this case–

174
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:57,097
and use contrasting Weights,
like Black and Light.

175
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,235
Or you can pick a single Weight
and use different contrasting Widths,

176
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,837
like Expanded and Compressed.

177
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:08,642
You can also combine both approaches
by mixing opposite Width and Weight,

178
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,712
for an even more decided contrast.

179
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,481
Together with the other
San Francisco families,

180
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,751
like SF Pro Rounded, SF Mono,

181
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,888
and also New York,
the serif system font,

182
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:25,692
the new Width styles open
a world of possible combinations.

183
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:30,831
In News, in addition to complementing
the editorial context of the app,

184
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:35,502
the Width styles provided
extra flexibility and practicality,

185
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,803
like in this example,

186
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:41,742
where using Condensed allows a long
Headline to be more space-efficient,

187
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,611
wrapping into four lines instead of five,

188
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,680
or even tighter, with Compressed,

189
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,316
which brings the title down
to three lines.

190
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,718
Opening up quite a bit of real estate
in the layout,

191
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:55,956
as well as making the Title stand up,
giving it more personality.

192
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,127
Notice also how the Expanded Widths,
used to contrast the Headline,

193
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,130
feel at home in captions and bylines.

194
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:08,635
We can see another specific but very
interesting use case for Expanded in Maps,

195
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,505
where the wide horizontal proportions
of this style

196
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,507
paired with loose tracking

197
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,377
work perfectly when used to represent
large geographical areas,

198
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,446
like mountain ranges.

199
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,683
But of course,
cartography's not just about mountains.

200
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:28,355
In fact, Maps adopted other Widths of SF
to create a rich typographic system,

201
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,791
with styles coherent between each other

202
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,493
but also diverse and contrasting,

203
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,297
making it easier to read
and tell apart all kinds of labels:

204
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,801
such as roads,
countries, continents, et cetera.

205
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,137
While, in most cases,
two or three styles are more than enough

206
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,440
to design an effective hierarchy,

207
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,476
this is a great demonstration
of how SF Pro can support

208
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,412
even the most elaborate graphic systems.

209
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:57,284
And those are just a few examples of how
to take advantage of the new Width styles.

210
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,387
The expanded functionality
and range of expression

211
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,891
make SF Pro an even more powerful
communication tool.

212
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:08,262
However, with great typographic power,
comes great responsibility.

213
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:12,766
Remember that fonts are design tools that
are meant to make interfaces beautiful,

214
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,103
but most importantly
legible and accessible.

215
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,438
Let's do a quick recap
with some of the considerations made

216
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:22,476
on the new Compressed,
Condensed, and Expanded styles.

217
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,580
First and foremost, the new Width styles
unlock an unprecedented level of control

218
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:31,118
in your layouts, giving you the ability
to make text wider or tighter

219
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:36,056
to efficiently design and arrange
typographic elements in your apps.

220
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,026
Also,
in addition to Weight, Size, and Color,

221
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,029
the new Width styles provide
more stylistic options

222
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:46,700
to create even more clear
and precise typographic hierarchies.

223
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,903
The fonts with more extreme
Weight and Width proportions

224
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:54,208
provide expressive styles that work great
at Display point sizes,

225
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:58,345
to elevate titles and headlines
from the rest of the UI.

226
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:02,015
All the SF Pro fonts cover most languages
using the Latin,

227
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,017
Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.

228
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,287
However, if localization is
an essential aspect of your app

229
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,923
and you're looking to provide
a consistent experience

230
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,859
across multiple writing systems,

231
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,994
other than the aforementioned ones,

232
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,963
make sure you have a fallback plan,

233
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:20,634
by identifying alternative solutions
that can help you localize your app.

234
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,805
Okay, so we did go through many
of the new features of the system font,

235
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,440
but we're not done yet.

236
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,910
There is another way
the family is expanding.

237
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,113
At Apple, we design for a global audience.

238
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,416
Our devices are used by people
from all around the world

239
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,553
who read and write different scripts
and languages.

240
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,356
Fonts play a huge role
in designing interfaces

241
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,125
that are both stylistically
and functionally consistent

242
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,528
across multiple languages,

243
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,899
providing integrity to the many
graphical elements featuring text.

244
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,834
And text is everywhere,

245
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:58,172
like in the Large Titles and Table Rows
in these screens,

246
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,507
but also in Buttons,

247
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,544
Platters, Icon labels.

248
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,213
Text is in Widgets, Keyboards,

249
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,248
Tab bars and many more,

250
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,618
in many more languages!

251
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,221
One area where
we incorporate these principles

252
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,691
and we can achieve
the highest level of consistency

253
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,761
is with experiences
that are self-contained

254
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:24,765
and can use fonts we design
for the ultimate localized experience,

255
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:28,635
allowing your screensaver on the Mac
to greet you in Japanese

256
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,139
and many other languages with
the iconic "hello" cursive style.

257
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,876
or the iPhone to display the time
using Arabic,

258
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,679
Arabic-Indic, or Devanagari numerals

259
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,682
with the same consistent typeface.

260
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,650
Or on the Typograph watch-face,

261
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:46,353
which features
five different numeral sets,

262
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,122
including the new Chinese numerals.

263
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:53,427
We want to bring the same level
of consistency to the system fonts,

264
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,830
which have to work
for a much broader range of applications.

265
00:14:56,864 --> 00:15:00,868
This requires extending
the linguistic coverage of San Francisco

266
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,971
and allowing other writing systems
to benefit from features

267
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,340
like Weights and Optical Sizes,

268
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,809
providing a reading experience that is,
at the same time,

269
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,844
visually engaging and comfortable,

270
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,981
for every script and language,
in any of our platforms.

271
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,683
This expansion started last year

272
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,553
when we introduced
the new Arabic system font,

273
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,321
SF Arabic.

274
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,224
We designed SF Arabic
to seamlessly integrate

275
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,094
with the rest
of the San Francisco families.

276
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,964
SF Arabic is a contemporary interpretation
of the Naskh style

277
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,001
with a rational and flexible design,

278
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:38,172
and it's the latest writing system,
after Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic,

279
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:41,074
to benefit from the most advanced
font technologies,

280
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,944
available on the Apple platforms.

281
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,313
Like the other San Francisco families,

282
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,049
it features the full gamut of weights,

283
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,351
Ultralight through Black,

284
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:55,355
and each of the nine weights has been
carefully designed to fit and combine

285
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,226
with the other scripts
and languages supported in SF.

286
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,163
Also, SF Arabic comes with Optical Sizes

287
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,233
tailored specifically
for the Arabic script.

288
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,603
Allowing the fonts to automatically adjust
the stroke contrast

289
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,972
and terminals and spacing,

290
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:16,376
adapting and scaling the design
between Display and Text sizes.

291
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,380
The Text styles are fine-tuned
for high Legibility and familiarity,

292
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,984
featuring a higher stroke contrast
and wider spacing.

293
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:28,555
While the Display styles morph into
a design with a simpler geometry,

294
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,359
blending with the clean
and contemporary look of San Francisco.

295
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,596
And all of this is automatically
and dynamically taken care of

296
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,064
by the system,

297
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:41,301
enabling a comfortable
reading experience at all sizes.

298
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,505
Like the Latin,
and Cyrillic writing systems,

299
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:47,274
the Arabic script is highly multilingual

300
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,544
and is used to write
not only the Arabic language,

301
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,446
but also a variety of other languages,

302
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,548
such as Persian, Pashto,

303
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:59,353
Sindhi, and many more,
all supported by SF Arabic.

304
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:02,856
Numerous vocalization,
tone, and poetic marks,

305
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,327
extended vowel signs, honorifics,
and Quranic annotations

306
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:12,132
complete the extensive character set
supported in SF Arabic.

307
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,235
And I'm excited to announce
that this year we're introducing

308
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,172
a new member to the San Francisco family,

309
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,307
SF Arabic Rounded.

310
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,744
Which packs the same great features
of SF Arabic,

311
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:29,116
coming with a full range of Weights,
and Optical Sizes.

312
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,920
The new Rounded design
enriches many apps and UIs.

313
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:36,990
Such as in Reminders and the Fitness app.

314
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,227
It expands the stylistic range
of SF Arabic,

315
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,729
and joins the rest of the system fonts,

316
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:49,303
making Arabic typography on Apple
platforms modern, clear, and refined.

317
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,840
If you want to see all the new
SF Arabic fonts in action

318
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:56,109
and want to learn more about the design
and optimization of apps

319
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,711
for the Arabic audience,

320
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,615
be sure to check out Mohamed's session,
"Design for Arabic".

321
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:05,886
The latest SF Pro,
SF Arabic, SF Arabic Rounded,

322
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,421
and all the other font families,

323
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:12,392
are available for download
on the developer.apple.com website.

324
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,595
And that's a wrap for this session.

325
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,964
I hope you enjoyed learning
about all the latest additions

326
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,632
to the system fonts.

327
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,033
Thank you for watching.

328
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,635
Ciao!
