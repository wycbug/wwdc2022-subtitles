00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,912
Karthik: Hi, I'm Karthik,

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,581
an engineer on the Messages team.

4
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:18,318
In this video,
I'm going to introduce Shared with You,

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,921
and how to adopt it in your app.

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,959
Shared with You was announced in iOS 15.

7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,830
It is designed to make it easier
for you to revisit links

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,667
that friends and family send you
in Messages.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,604
System applications that have
adopted Shared with You are

10
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,240
Safari, News,

11
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,910
Music, Podcasts,

12
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:46,213
the TV app and Photos.

13
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:51,351
Shared with You meets you
where you're consuming content.

14
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:56,390
Many times content is received
when we are not ready to consume it.

15
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:01,028
For example, a friend sends
a recommendation for a TV show

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,630
while you are out grocery shopping,

17
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,901
and then it's forgotten
in the course of the day.

18
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:12,840
Shared with You makes it easier
to discover this TV show later on

19
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:17,477
when you are browsing
for TV shows to watch in the TV app

20
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:22,816
Shared with You makes it convenient to
pick up a Messages conversation

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,252
right from within the app,

22
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,456
allowing you to stay in context
of shared content

23
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,792
without leaving the app.

24
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,964
Your content can be pinned in Messages.

25
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:42,436
It elevates the content
in Shared with You and Search.

26
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,405
This is a signal
that content is important,

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,809
and starts the flow
of automatic sharing consent.

28
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,211
More on that later.

29
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:57,618
In iOS 16, Shared with You is extended
to include your apps, links, and content.

30
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,822
This takes the convenience of
Shared with You and puts it in your apps.

31
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,927
I'll first talk about the design
of Shared with You in your app,

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,997
then show you how it works,

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,066
and then walk you through
how to adopt Shared with You.

34
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,203
Starting with design.

35
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:21,208
There are two parts of Shared with You
that are part of your app experience:

36
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:26,013
The Shared with You shelf,
and the Shared with You attribution view.

37
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,516
The Shared with You shelf
is a dedicated space

38
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,386
in your app's browsing experience

39
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:37,090
that highlights content
that was shared in Messages.

40
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:44,198
For example, the TV app's "Watch Now" tab
has a Shared with You shelf.

41
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:48,502
So does the Listen Now tab
in Music and Podcasts.

42
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:55,475
The content provided by Shared with You
is a ranked and ordered list.

43
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,879
I'll go over that later in the video.

44
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,949
For each item
in the Shared with You shelf,

45
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:07,087
show a rich preview
along with an attribution view.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,391
A rich preview has thumbnail, a title,

47
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,361
and a subtitle if applicable.

48
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:19,166
In this example, the rich preview
consists of podcast art,

49
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,669
episode name, and the show name.

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,341
There is also an attribution view
for each shared content

51
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,610
in the Shared with You shelf.

52
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,479
This is the all of the information
that allows context

53
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,681
to be gleaned at a glance.

54
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,486
Have a Show More element
that can expand the view

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,024
or navigate to showing all of your app's
Shared with You content.

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,794
The Attribution view
is an out of process view

57
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:54,434
that securely displays the names
and avatars of who shared it.

58
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:59,907
It also shows
if the content was pinned in Messages.

59
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,012
Show the attribution view
in the details view of your content.

60
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:09,216
This allows people to connect
content in your app

61
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,886
back to the Messages conversation
it was shared in.

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,124
For example,
when I'm browsing for a TV show to watch,

63
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:23,497
the attribution view helps me recall
that a friend had recommend it.

64
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,202
I can quickly tell my friend
that I'm about to watch the show.

65
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,872
All this happens right in app,

66
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:36,376
and after replying,
I'm right back at the content.

67
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,179
The attribution view is interactive.

68
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,482
Tapping on the view takes you
to the Messages conversation

69
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,185
right from within the application.

70
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:50,123
The attribution view also presents
contextual menu options

71
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,994
such as "Reply" and "Remove".

72
00:04:54,027 --> 00:05:00,968
The "Reply" content menu option
functions similar to tapping the view.

73
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,638
The "Remove" context menu option
is a way to tell the Shared with You

74
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,509
not to surface a piece of content
going forward.

75
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:12,346
The same contextual menus
are made available to you

76
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,717
to add to your content's contextual menus.

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,488
The title for the Remove context menu
can be customized.

78
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,358
For example in Safari,

79
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:29,396
the contextual menu
for the web page shows "Remove Link".

80
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:35,269
I'll go over how you can do this
in your app later on in this video.

81
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,872
Now you know where to present
a Shared with You shelf

82
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:42,242
and where to show the Attribution View.

83
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,045
Let me show you how Shared with You works.

84
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:52,386
Links shared by friends and family in
Messages are surfaced in Shared with You.

85
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,589
Links in group conversations are surfaced

86
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:59,826
when at least one participant
is a contact.

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,332
Shared with You is based on the same
technology behind Universal Links.

88
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:11,505
Universal Links allows for
seamless linking to content in your app

89
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,208
or on your website.

90
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:19,346
Users have granular control
over Shared with You content.

91
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:25,118
They can choose what content is shared
outside of Messages

92
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,988
on a per conversation basis,

93
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,124
per app, or globally.

94
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:36,396
This permission doesn't need
to be requested in advance.

95
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,399
It happens organically.

96
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:46,340
Pinning links is implicit permission
to surface the content in Shared with You.

97
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:52,012
Pinned content is always available
to Shared with You in your app.

98
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:57,951
Based on heuristics when content
for your app is pinned in Messages,

99
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:03,123
an option to enable
automatic sharing is presented.

100
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,527
When automatic sharing is turned on,

101
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,299
further content is automatically available
to Shared with You in your app.

102
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,304
Content in Shared with You is ordered.

103
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:22,910
The first item in the Shared with You
shelf is curated by Siri Suggestions

104
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,914
based on various signals from the system.

105
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,751
This is followed by Pinned items

106
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,788
and the remainder of the list
is chronologically ordered.

107
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,661
Siri Suggestions uses signals
such as "Has the user viewed

108
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,130
or interacted with the content?"

109
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,032
Is the content Pinned?

110
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,902
In which context
is the content being presented?

111
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,539
Your app plays a part
in providing this feedback.

112
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,443
I'll go over in detail
a little later on in the video.

113
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:02,649
All this is done to ensure that content
is not too transient or stale.

114
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:07,521
In a conversation
when a link is shared multiple times,

115
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:12,726
Shared with You surfaces
only the most recent message.

116
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,331
When a link is shared in
multiple Messages conversations,

117
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:23,470
Shared with You visually represents
that via the attribution view.

118
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,908
For example,
both Enrique and Sarah have shared

119
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,178
the Top 25 Chicago playlist.

120
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:36,984
The attribution view shows
both their contact avatars.

121
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,889
Tapping on the attribution view
presents a disambiguation menu,

122
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:47,861
allowing you to choose which Messages
conversation to reply to.

123
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,064
Security and Privacy
was a primary consideration

124
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,967
and focus when designing Shared with You.

125
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:58,105
The attribution views
and disambiguation views

126
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:02,309
are drawn on your behalf out of process.

127
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,279
Shared with You protects
your app's content

128
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,215
via the Universal Links association

129
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:12,219
so it is accessible to only your app.

130
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:17,958
Apps do not have access to Messages
recipients and conversations.

131
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,196
Now you know how Shared with You works.

132
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,131
On to the most exciting part–

133
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,568
how to adopt Shared with You in your app.

134
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,104
First, adopt Universal Links.

135
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,441
Then, add the new Shared with You
Capability,

136
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,411
under the Capabilities tab in Xcode.

137
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:41,682
Then, put a Shared with You shelf
in your app,

138
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:46,420
and add attribution view
to your content.

139
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,224
Let me briefly talk about
adopting Universal Links.

140
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:56,730
Universal Links allows your users
to intelligently follow links to content

141
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,633
in your app or to your website.

142
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,537
Take the following steps
to support universal links.

143
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,974
First create a two-way association

144
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,477
between your app and your website

145
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:14,715
and specify the URLs
that your app handles.

146
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:20,854
You create them by adding the Associated
Domains entitlement to your app,

147
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:26,126
and by adding a JSON file
to your web server.

148
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,929
Next, update your app delegate

149
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,966
to respond to the user activity object
the system provides

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,670
when a universal link routes to your app.

151
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:42,409
For more information, please watch
the "What's new in Universal Links" video.

152
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:47,614
In iOS 16 we have introduced
a new Framework called Shared with You.

153
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,752
There are three main classes
in the Shared with You Framework:

154
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,121
SWHighlightCenter,

155
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:59,026
SWHighlight, and SWAttributionView.

156
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:03,497
SWHighlightCenter is the class that helps
you get Shared with You content

157
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,831
for your app.

158
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:10,204
SWHighlight is a model object
that wraps your app's shared content.

159
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:15,042
SWAttributionView is the view
that helps connect your content

160
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,778
back to a Messages conversation

161
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,547
and displays attribution information.

162
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,953
The highlight center is
a simple object that consists of:

163
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:31,358
Highlights,
which is an array of SWHighlight objects;

164
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:35,462
and a delegate property
by which apps get notified

165
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:41,768
when there is content added,
removed, or updated by Shared with You.

166
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:46,373
A highlight is represented
by the SWHighlight class.

167
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:52,513
It is used to pass the URL for your app's
content that was shared in Messages.

168
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:57,317
You use it to refer to your content,
render a rich preview,

169
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:01,021
and navigate to the content in your app.

170
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,726
Let me show you how to enumerate
Shared with You content in your app.

171
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:12,299
First create an instance
of SWHighlightCenter.

172
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:16,670
Then set the delegate property.

173
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:22,109
Implement the SWHighlightCenterDelegate
method.

174
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,811
Use the highlights property
on the highlight center

175
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:29,149
to access your app's Shared with You
content.

176
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:32,786
Apps can choose to keep
the previous list of highlights

177
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:37,491
in order to quickly diff that list
against the latest list.

178
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:44,464
Use the URL property on each highlight
to generate a Rich preview

179
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,634
of your app's content.

180
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:53,674
And it's as easy as that to enumerate
Shared with You content in your app.

181
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:59,012
Next, I'll show you how to add
and customize the Attribution View

182
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,548
to your app's Shared with You content.

183
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:07,254
SWAttributionView is the view
that shows the names and avatars

184
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,090
of who shared the content.

185
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,595
Each highlight has
a corresponding attribution view.

186
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,831
Setting the highlight Property
on the attribution view

187
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:22,102
triggers the out of process rendering
of the attribution information.

188
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:28,275
Specify a maximum width
the attribution view can take.

189
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:34,281
The attribution view will fill
or fit the space as needed.

190
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:39,853
Set the alignment of the attribution view
within the maximum space.

191
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,321
Let me show you an example.

192
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,693
Create an instance of SWAttributionView

193
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,897
and set the highlight property.

194
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,699
Set the preferredMaxLayoutWidth.

195
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:57,905
In this example it spans the bottom
of the shared content thumbnail.

196
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,507
Constrain this view's width anchor

197
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:05,879
or set its frame width to control
the maximum width of its contents.

198
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:09,950
Set the maximum AX content size category
for the view as necessary

199
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,153
using:
minimumContentSizeCategory

200
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:18,392
or maximumContentSizeCategory
properties on UIView.

201
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:22,162
Provide enough vertical space
around this view.

202
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,166
The view's height is dependent
on the preferredContentSizeCategory,

203
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,836
and the resulting font size.

204
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,306
If the view's height
is unnecessarily constrained,

205
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,310
then the view might be clipped
or not get drawn.

206
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:40,747
The horizontalAlignment is set
to leading in this case.

207
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:44,084
It can also be set to Center

208
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,887
or Trailing.

209
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,725
Next, let me show you how to customize
the Attribution view.

210
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,561
Setting a display context helps inform
the system

211
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,866
about how the user is consuming
the attributed content.

212
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,303
It also influences ranking of
Shared with You content for your app.

213
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,106
Set this before it's added to a window.

214
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,077
The background style of
the attribution view can be customized

215
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,615
based on the content's background
it is being used against.

216
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,284
Let me show you an example.

217
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:22,990
The default value for
displayContext property is summary.

218
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:28,762
This indicates that the content
is being shown for consumption.

219
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,198
Set the displayContext to detail

220
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,401
when the user is actively consuming
the content,

221
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,173
like watching a movie
or listening to a podcast.

222
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:43,510
Setting the displayContext
is the feedback your app can provide.

223
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:47,548
This'll help Siri Suggestions
rank content for you app.

224
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:51,385
Set the background style
for the attribution view to color

225
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:55,355
when placing the attribution view
over monochrome backgrounds

226
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,558
like in this example.

227
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:03,964
Use material when placing the attribution
view over multicolored backgrounds.

228
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:08,669
This sets a material background blur
for the view's contents.

229
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:14,041
In this example, Safari's landing page
has a background image.

230
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,611
The contents of the attribution view
are more visible

231
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,582
by setting the correct background style.

232
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:26,086
Next let me show you how to add Shared
with You Contextual Menus

233
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:30,324
to your app's content
and customize the title.

234
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:34,127
The existing contextual menu
attached to your app's content

235
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:39,032
can be supplemented
by the attribution view's menu.

236
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:42,669
This menu should be added inline with

237
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:48,175
or at the end of the contextual menu
it augments.

238
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:53,814
A custom title for the Remove contextual
menu option can be provided.

239
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:59,052
The string should include the word
"Remove", localized correctly.

240
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:04,391
In this example, Safari has customized
the Remove menu title to "Remove Link"

241
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,762
in its content's context menu at the end.

242
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,533
Let me show you how to do this
via an example.

243
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:16,036
First create an instance
of the attribution view

244
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,505
and set the highlight property.

245
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,975
Provide a custom title
for the Remove context menu

246
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,945
via the menuTitleForHideAction.

247
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:28,081
When configuring
your content's context menu,

248
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:34,188
get the menu from the attribution view
via the supplementalMenu property.

249
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:38,692
Then append them
to your content's context menu.

250
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:43,363
These easy steps allow your app
to add the context menu option

251
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:49,336
available on the attribution view
to your content's context menus.

252
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:54,508
Now you know all that is needed
to adopt Shared with You in your app.

253
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:59,680
Let's recap the three easy steps
to adopt Shared with You in your app.

254
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,849
Go adopt Universal Links.

255
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:07,354
Then add the new Shared with You
Capability in Xcode for your app.

256
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:11,625
Import and use the new
Shared with You framework.

257
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:15,462
I'm looking forward to sharing
your content in Messages

258
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,498
and using Shared with You in your app.

259
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,869
Thank you for your time and attention.
