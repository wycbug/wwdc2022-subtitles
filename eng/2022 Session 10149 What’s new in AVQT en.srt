Ahmed Badr: Hello and welcome.

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,348
My name is Ahmed and I am part
of the Display and Color Technologies team

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,415
at Apple.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,620
Today, I would like to talk about some of
the new features and enhancements we made

6
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,824
in the Advanced Video Quality Tool,
or short AVQT.

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,693
Let me start with a quick recap.

8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,762
So what's AVQT?

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:34,268
AVQT is a command line executable
that we first released in WWDC 2021.

10
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,105
It's a full reference video quality metric
that assesses the quality of videos

11
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,208
with potential compression
and scaling artifacts.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:45,212
It attempts to mimic
how people rate the quality of videos.

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:51,218
AVQT supports all AVFoundation-based
video formats, both SDR and HDR.

14
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:56,023
This includes HDR10, HLG,
and Dolby Vision.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,860
There are three key attributes
that are unique to AVQT.

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,531
First, AVQT achieves high correlation
with how people rate videos.

17
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,266
This applies to all content types

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,603
such as animation, natural scenes,
and sports.

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,340
Second, AVQT comes with
impressive processing speeds,

20
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,743
thanks to AVFoundation and Metal
that AVQT relies on

21
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,146
for video decoding and processing.

22
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:23,650
Third, AVQT is designed to accommodate
different viewing setups.

23
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,286
The same video can result
in different experiences

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,121
depending on the viewing setup.

25
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,657
This can be configured
in AVQT through factors

26
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,461
such as display resolution,
display size, and viewing distance.

27
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,566
To learn more about AVQT,
please check our 2021 video

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,637
titled "Evaluate videos
with Advanced Video Quality Tool."

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,574
In the WWDC 2021 video
where AVQT was announced,

30
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,311
we presented the impressive
processing speeds it achieves on M1 Macs.

31
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:56,984
Since then, Apple processors
got more capable and AVQT got faster.

32
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:01,054
Here are the processing speeds
on the new family of M1 processors.

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,691
On M1 Ultra, AVQT evaluates a 2-hour,

34
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:08,862
HEVC-compressed 4K movie in 20 minutes.

35
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,598
This is six times faster than real time.

36
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,268
For a full HD movie
with a similar duration,

37
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,938
AVQT processes the video
in less than 11 minutes.

38
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,675
This is more than ten times faster
than real time.

39
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,279
You can now evaluate more videos
in the same amount of time.

40
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,650
Next, let me introduce
the new features and enhancements

41
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,986
that we added to AVQT this year.

42
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,590
You can now visualize
the quality of your video using AVQT

43
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,825
without any extra steps.

44
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,329
The latest version of AVQT produces
HTML-based reports

45
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,765
with interactive plots and diagrams

46
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,968
showing analysis of the quality
of your videos.

47
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,072
These reports can easily be generated
by adding the new ‘visualize’ flag.

48
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,576
You can easily identify
sections in your video

49
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,545
where quality did not meet
the expectation.

50
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,882
You can also share AVQT reports
with other colleagues.

51
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,152
They don't need to have AVQT
or any other tool installed.

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,321
They can just open the report in Safari.

53
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,792
So let me show you how to create
an interactive report

54
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,061
and how to use some of its features.

55
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,365
I will start by showing the help menu.

56
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,501
We added a new argument, ‘visualize,’

57
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,970
which you can use to create reports.

58
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,608
Here's an AVQT command that evaluates
the quality of a test video that I created

59
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:32,045
by compressing a segment
from last year's WWDC presentation.

60
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,984
You can then add the visualize argument
and it will also create a report.

61
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,319
Once it's done, you will see the location

62
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,756
of the HTML report file
printed to standard out.

63
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,259
This file can simply be opened in Safari.

64
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:50,364
The table on the left shows information
about the analyzed videos.

65
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,133
The one on the right includes
settings and parameters used

66
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,102
while evaluating the videos.

67
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,943
This figure shows both frame-level
and segment-level AVQT scores over time.

68
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,015
If you're interested
in a specific interval,

69
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,784
you can simply zoom in
to get more details.

70
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,756
Hovering over the plot will give you
more information about that point,

71
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,459
such as time,
AVQT score, and index of the frame

72
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,361
or segment that this score belongs to.

73
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,267
To zoom out to the home view, you can
double-click anywhere in the figure.

74
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,540
A pie chart is also included
that shows the distribution

75
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:37,010
of the AVQT frame scores
of the analyzed video.

76
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,479
It shows the percentage
and number of frames

77
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:44,184
in each of the five quality categories,
"Bad," "Poor," "Fair,"

78
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,286
"Good," and "Excellent".

79
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,824
The figures on the bottom
are similar to those on the top

80
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,293
except that they show PSNR scores.

81
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:01,034
We hope this feature will help
summarize the quality of your videos

82
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,704
as well as identify issues, if any.

83
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,707
Here's another feature that I am
excited to tell you about.

84
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,376
You can now specify the time windows
from your reference

85
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,945
and test videos to be evaluated.

86
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,416
This enables focusing on a specific scene
or multiple scenes in your video.

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,754
It also allows for comparing videos
that are not temporally aligned.

88
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,992
We added four new command-line
arguments to help you accurately specify

89
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,862
the beginning and end of the video
sections you are interested in analyzing.

90
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:34,001
Let me show you an example
of how to use the time window feature.

91
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,971
Here's the video
I evaluated in the previous demo.

92
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:42,075
This time, I am interested
in evaluating a single scene of the video.

93
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,745
Here's how I can accomplish this.

94
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,749
In Quicktime Player, I will start
by seeking to that scene.

95
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,318
It's this one.

96
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,221
Clicking here shows the frame index.

97
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:58,659
I will use the arrow keys
to get to the first frame in the scene.

98
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,394
It's 270.

99
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:04,531
I will repeat the same steps to find
the last frame in the scene.

100
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,267
It's frame 486.

101
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,971
Now, let's evaluate this scene in AVQT.

102
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,707
The first part of the command
is the same as before.

103
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,011
I will then add the start and end frame
indices I got from QuickTime Player

104
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,415
using these four newly-added
command line arguments.

105
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,887
I now have the AVQT score for this scene.

106
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,892
Running this command is faster
than processing the whole video

107
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,494
and then only looking
at the scores of that scene.

108
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,831
We believe this adds
to the flexibility of AVQT.

109
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,235
Speaking of flexibility,
we also extended the support

110
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,371
of raw YUV formats in this version.

111
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,508
AVQT supports
all AVFoundation video formats.

112
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,578
Besides that,
it also supports raw YUV videos.

113
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,214
This enables scoring videos
that were never compressed,

114
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,183
such as a raw camera feed.

115
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,152
It's also useful when evaluating
videos that are compressed

116
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,456
and decoded outside the ecosystem.

117
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,293
This year, we extended the support
for raw YUV to include a total

118
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:11,398
of 20 formats with a wide range
of chroma sub-samplings and bit depths.

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,567
It's worth noting that `reference-fourcc`

120
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,570
and `test-fourcc` flags
are now deprecated.

121
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,706
We replaced them
with two separate sets of flags,

122
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,709
one for chroma-subsampling
and another for bit-depth.

123
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,880
This feature will allow you
to evaluate more videos

124
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,982
without the need of pre-processing.

125
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,755
Since AVQT was
first released in WWDC 2021,

126
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,724
there has been
a growing interest in the tool.

127
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,160
We received
numerous comments and requests.

128
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:44,097
One of the most common requests
is to add support for Linux.

129
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:48,702
Today, we are glad to announce
that AVQT is now available on Linux.

130
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,808
We understand that this will allow people
to evaluate content stored in the cloud

131
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:59,780
or compressed in Linux-based servers
without the need to move the videos.

132
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,851
Together with the macOS version,
we are also releasing a beta version

133
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,988
of AVQT for Linux that supports
a wide range of Linux distributions.

134
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:12,492
It can be easily deployed as it doesn't
require any external dependencies.

135
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,229
It's essentially plug and play.

136
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,198
To learn more about the supported
Linux distributions and versions,

137
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,468
please refer to the README file
in the AVQT package.

138
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,806
The Linux version of AVQT is
designed to have the same look

139
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,208
and feel of the macOS version.

140
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,211
It uses the same naming
of the command line flags

141
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,648
and produces output files
of the same format.

142
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,118
The Linux version supports
all 20 raw formats that are included

143
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,221
in the latest version of the macOS tool.

144
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,858
The viewing conditions parameters are not
available in the Linux beta version

145
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,793
but will be enabled in the future.

146
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,331
To wrap up,
here are a few important takeaways.

147
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:56,570
AVQT is a perceptual video quality tool
that we released in WWDC 2021.

148
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,840
It's available for download
on the developers’ portal.

149
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,177
If you haven't tried the tool,
go ahead and use it.

150
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,613
This year,
we added several enhancements to AVQT.

151
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:10,684
You can now visualize AVQT scores
of your videos in an interactive

152
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,688
HTML-based report that you can
share with your colleagues.

153
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,324
You can also use the new
‘Time Window’ feature to focus

154
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,160
on the quality
of specific scenes in your video.

155
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:23,864
And finally, for those of you
who have videos in the cloud

156
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,702
or use Linux-based video encoders,
AVQT is now available on Linux.

157
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,305
Thank you very much.
