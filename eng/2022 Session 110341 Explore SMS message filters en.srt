00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,979
Hello and welcome to WWDC.

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
My name is Ajay Singh,

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,184
and today I am excited to take you
on a journey

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,487
to explore SMS message filters.

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:24,391
These allow you to create
message filter extensions

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:29,196
which help people categorize incoming
SMS messages

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,798
from unknown senders.

9
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:37,504
First, I will describe how
SMS message filters work.

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:43,477
Next, I will talk about
what's new in iOS 16.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,883
I will walk through an example of how
to build a message filter extension

12
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,920
using iOS 16 APIs,

13
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:57,157
then show you what people will see
in Messages

14
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,527
when they use your extension.

15
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,031
Finally, I will talk about enhancements

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,167
to Apple's SMS filter for India.

17
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,505
Let's talk about SMS message filters.

18
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:17,811
In many countries,
SMS messages are now used by businesses

19
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,315
to notify customers about transactions,

20
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:25,452
marketing campaigns,
alerts, and reminders.

21
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:30,858
In this example you
can see a mix of SMS messages

22
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,160
including short codes,

23
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,431
alphanumeric codes,
and standard phone numbers.

24
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,901
This results in a very cluttered inbox,

25
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,571
and it's really difficult
to find personal messages

26
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,306
from your loved ones.

27
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:54,414
iOS does provide an option
to filter messages from unknown senders,

28
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,018
but if you receive several messages
each day,

29
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,589
even the unknown sender folder
will quickly get filled

30
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,625
with unread messages.

31
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:10,731
Automated filtering of SMS messages
is important to many people,

32
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,433
and iOS provides a secure

33
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,503
sandbox-based extension model

34
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:21,675
that allow you to further classify
messages from unknown senders.

35
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:28,215
People can find and install
SMS filter apps from the App Store.

36
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,819
Once installed,
you can turn on message filtering

37
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,723
by going to Settings, Messages,

38
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:42,663
Unknown & Spam,
and turning on Filter Unknown Senders.

39
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:47,601
Then, you can select
your SMS filter of choice.

40
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,205
Here we have installed two SMS filters.

41
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:56,376
Note that only one filter
can be active at a time.

42
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,781
In iOS 14 and later,

43
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,484
new folders will appear in Messages

44
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:09,122
for Transactions, Promotions, and Junk.

45
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:14,661
These folders help people organize
and find messages

46
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,397
that are most relevant to them.

47
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,534
Regardless of which filter is chosen,

48
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:25,205
Messages provide
the same classification structure

49
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,810
consisting of Transactions,
Promotions, and Junk.

50
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,913
We have heard from you loud and clear,

51
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,217
that you would like to provide
more detailed classifications.

52
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:42,523
So in iOS 16
we are introducing enhancements

53
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,159
to the filter classification API.

54
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,696
Now your SMS message filter extension

55
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,701
can classify messages
into 12 additional sub-categories.

56
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,140
Here are the new sub-categories
that you can specify

57
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,911
in your SMS filter extension.

58
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:09,516
The new sub-categories fall under
the existing top level categories–

59
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,819
Transactions and Promotions.

60
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,223
Now you can further refine
incoming messages

61
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,593
and provide an even better experience.

62
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,796
For example, in markets like India,

63
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,500
it's common to receive
a large number of messages

64
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,536
related to financial transactions.

65
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,140
These include activities
in their bank account

66
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,443
and alerts for credit card spending.

67
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,514
These messages can now
be nicely organized

68
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,952
in the Finance sub-folder
under Transactions.

69
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:50,557
Let's see how the flow works
for SMS message filters.

70
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,994
We can divide the flow into two phases;

71
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:58,332
configuration and runtime classification.

72
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,734
In the configuration phase,

73
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:05,072
users select your message filter
in Settings.

74
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:10,644
This triggers a new API
introduced in iOS 16

75
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:15,382
to request the capabilities
supported by your filter.

76
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:20,454
You can now respond with a list
of supported categories

77
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,489
and sub-categories.

78
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:26,159
In this example,
the filter reports

79
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,296
that it supports the sub-categories

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,634
Finance, Orders, and Coupons.

81
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,904
iOS validates these capabilities

82
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:40,073
and updates the inbox in Messages

83
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:43,310
with the appropriate folders.

84
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,413
In the runtime classification phase,

85
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:52,286
every time an SMS message is received
from an unknown sender,

86
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,621
iOS queries your filter

87
00:05:54,655 --> 00:06:00,327
to determine which category
and sub-category it belongs to.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,732
You can also see the terms
action and sub-action used here.

89
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:10,037
Filters must respond with
one of the capabilities declared

90
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,472
in the configuration phase.

91
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,709
The SMS message will then appear

92
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,047
in the corresponding sub-folder
in Messages.

93
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,251
Let's build
a simple message filter extension

94
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:28,055
to see how the APIs are used

95
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,658
and what people will see in Messages.

96
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,829
In Xcode, you start by creating

97
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,933
a new Message Filter Extension target.

98
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:45,772
The Message Filter Extension target
appears as one of the options

99
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,509
when you create a new target

100
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,311
and go to template selection.

101
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:56,316
Select the Message Filter Extension
and click Next.

102
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,054
Now give your filter a name
and click Finish.

103
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,591
When the target is created,

104
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:09,630
MessageFilterExtension.swift
will be auto-populated

105
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,065
with all the required functions.

106
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,203
In iOS 16, we have a new API handle

107
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,573
called capabilitiesRequest.

108
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,578
Fill in the
ILMessageFilterCapabilitiesQueryResponse

109
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:29,816
structure with the transactional
or promotional sub-actions

110
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,518
that you support.

111
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,689
You can specify up to five sub-actions.

112
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,860
Here we are indicating support
for Finance,

113
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:44,498
Orders, and Health sub-actions
under Transactions,

114
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:49,670
and Coupons and Offers sub-actions
under Promotions.

115
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,307
Now build and install
your filter extension.

116
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,844
When you choose your filter in Settings,

117
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:00,047
the Message inbox will be updated

118
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,383
with the sub-actions we declared;

119
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:09,523
Finance, Orders, and Health appear
under Transactions,

120
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:15,495
and Coupons and Offers
appear under Promotions.

121
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,634
Now, we have confirmed
that our configuration works.

122
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,370
Let's define some simple logic

123
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,974
to return suitable categories to iOS

124
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,445
when an incoming SMS message is received.

125
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:38,485
First, we extract the message body text
from the queryRequest object.

126
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,356
If the message contains specific keywords,

127
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,628
we return a suitable matching action
and sub-action.

128
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:53,166
Here, we have added the code
where if the keyword is debited

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,171
then we will return filterAction
as Transaction

130
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:02,075
and filterSubaction
as transactionalfinance.

131
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:06,713
Similarly, when the message has
the keyword coupon,

132
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:12,252
then Promotion and PromotionalCoupons
will be returned.

133
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,088
You can also update the business logic

134
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:21,361
for other sub classifications within
Transactions and Promotions.

135
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:25,566
Note that if you return
an incorrect combination

136
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,336
for filterAction and filterSubAction,

137
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,072
iOS will discard the sub-action

138
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,808
and only honor the action.

139
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:39,680
For example,
if we return the action Transaction

140
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,982
and sub-action Coupons,

141
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:47,321
then the message will only go
to the All Transaction folder.

142
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:53,560
Here, we have an example
of SMS received from bank

143
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,963
with the keyword "debited"

144
00:09:55,996 --> 00:10:00,400
and it has been classified
under Finance sub-folder by Messages.

145
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,738
Here is another example

146
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:10,511
where we have received a Black Friday Deal
with the keyword "coupon."

147
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:15,716
In Messages it has been classified
under the Coupons sub-folder.

148
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,255
In iOS 16,
you can choose sub-categories

149
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,492
that are the best fit
for your user demographics.

150
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:31,031
In the first example, the SMS message
filter shows folders

151
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,735
for Orders, Reminders, Health,

152
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:40,007
Public Services, and Weather
under Transactions,

153
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,279
while the second example shows
folders for Finance,

154
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,615
Reminders, Health, and Rewards

155
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,517
under Transactions

156
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,954
and Offers under Promotions.

157
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,458
Your filter extension can use
these sub-categories

158
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:03,630
to provide a differentiated experience
for your users.

159
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:08,035
Apple provides an SMS filter in India,

160
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:13,841
and we have updated it
using the enhancements in iOS 16.

161
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:17,277
The Apple SMS filter in India

162
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,814
now supports additional sub-folders

163
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,084
including Finance, Orders,

164
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,321
and Reminders under Transactions.

165
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,825
Your bank transactions appear in Finance,

166
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,495
your food
or commercial delivery messages

167
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,065
are organized under Orders,

168
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:43,504
while important events and to-do's
appear in the Reminders folder.

169
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:50,043
To wrap up, in this video
we talked about SMS message filters

170
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:54,581
and how they can classify messages
into Transactions,

171
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:57,351
Promotions, and Junk.

172
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,722
In iOS 16,
your message filter extension

173
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:07,561
can now classify messages
into 12 additional sub-categories.

174
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,164
To learn more, see the API documentation

175
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,101
in the link accompanying this video.

176
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:18,639
I look forward to seeing your new
and creative ideas

177
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:22,442
