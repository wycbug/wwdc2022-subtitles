Mahesh Molakalapalli:
My name is Mahesh Molakalapalli.

3
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:16,083
I am an engineering manager on
the App Store and App Analytics team.

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:20,020
Our goal with App Analytics
is to help you grow your business

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:24,024
by providing you with the unique
insights about your app.

6
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:28,629
Today, I am going to introduce you
to an exciting new feature

7
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,098
called App Benchmarking

8
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,636
that will help you get better insights
than ever before.

9
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:39,706
We will begin with an overview
of benchmarking.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,779
Then we'll talk about the metrics for
which you can see benchmarking data.

11
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:50,684
Next, we'll show you how we create
relevant benchmarks

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:55,155
while protecting the privacy of all apps.

13
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,526
And we will wrap up by showing you
how you can take action

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,530
on insights gained from benchmarking.

15
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,132
Let's get started.

16
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,868
Many of you may already use App Analytics.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,537
In this tool, we share data with you

18
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:15,409
about your app's acquisition,
usage, and monetization.

19
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,546
Let's say that you are a developer
of an app called Mountain Climber,

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,650
which is a travel app
offering subscriptions.

21
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:28,655
The overview page shows how
Mountain Climber is performing over time,

22
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,558
across key performance metrics

23
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:36,864
that allows you to monitor results
in each stage of the customer lifecycle,

24
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:42,236
from awareness
to conversion and on to retention.

25
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,771
Since you're focused on growth,

26
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:49,643
let's say that one of your top
business priorities for your app

27
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,479
has been to improve your conversion rate.

28
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:56,483
Looking at the data,
you have been making steady improvement,

29
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:00,888
with a 5.5% increase
over the last 90 days.

30
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,758
But what is unclear
is how much more improvement

31
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,262
you might be able to achieve
with continued effort.

32
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,664
Do you have more opportunity to grow,

33
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,535
or should you focus your efforts
somewhere else?

34
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,838
That's where peer group benchmarking
comes in.

35
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,607
You can learn
about the performance of apps

36
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,144
that are similar to your app
in a privacy-friendly way,

37
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:28,415
and check how you are performing
relative to them.

38
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,584
Like your Mountain Climber app,

39
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:34,621
all the apps
on the right hand side are travel apps,

40
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,724
with a subscription business model.

41
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:42,963
Let's take a look at how your App is doing
compared to this group.

42
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:48,836
You can see the same apps,
arranged left to right,

43
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,673
from lowest to highest conversion rates.

44
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,610
So how does your app stack up
against all the others?

45
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,347
Although your conversion rate
has been improving over time,

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,784
you are still in the bottom half
of your peer group.

47
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,119
There's plenty of room for improvement.

48
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,989
Benchmarking provides insights like this

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,728
without revealing the performance
of any individual app in your peer group.

50
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:20,501
We do this by including enough apps
to provide meaningful results

51
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,869
in the aggregate

52
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:26,373
so that it doesn't reveal
any individual app's performance.

53
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,543
And in order to show
your relative position,

54
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,381
we show you what the distribution
of your peer group looks like

55
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:40,053
such as the 25th, 50th,
and 75th percentiles of your group.

56
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,324
You will then be able to see
how you are performing

57
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,293
relative to your peer group,

58
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,363
and understand
whether you have growth opportunity,

59
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,900
or whether
you're already beating the competition.

60
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,437
Now that you have an idea
of what peer group benchmarking is

61
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,640
and why it is so important,

62
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:04,611
let us talk about the metrics that you
will be able to use in this feature.

63
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:09,449
One of our goals with benchmarking
is to give you insight

64
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:14,288
into how your app is performing
throughout the customer lifecycle.

65
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:20,160
That's why we will be offering benchmarks
for metrics related to acquisition,

66
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,963
usage, and monetization.

67
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,699
To help you measure
your acquisition efforts,

68
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,036
we will provide you with
conversion rate benchmarks.

69
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,440
Conversion rate helps you understand
how often people download

70
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,978
or redownload your app
after seeing it on the App Store.

71
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,847
The higher your conversion rate,

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,617
the more efficiently
you are acquiring your customers.

73
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,089
To help you measure usage,
you will be able to see Day 1,

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,359
Day 7, and Day 28 retention.

75
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,129
Retention helps you understand
what percentage of people return

76
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,699
to your app one day after download,

77
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,133
seven days after download,

78
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,369
and 28 days after download,

79
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,807
and is a good indicator
of how engaging your app is

80
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,408
for your customers.

81
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,747
You will also be able to see
how your crash rate stacks up

82
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,682
against your peers.

83
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:19,186
If your app is prone to crashing
more often than normal,

84
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,390
it may negatively impact your engagement
and monetization metrics,

85
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,627
so it's good to keep this
as low as possible.

86
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:32,032
Finally, to help you evaluate
your monetization strategy,

87
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:37,471
you will be able to see benchmarks
around average proceeds per paying user.

88
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:42,075
This will allow you to see how much money
your peers take home

89
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,444
from each of their paying customers,

90
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,314
so you can see how you compare.

91
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,385
Now that you know what metrics
you will be able to see,

92
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,222
let us talk about relevancy and privacy.

93
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,424
Throughout the development
of this feature,

94
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,260
we have strived to create peer groups

95
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:03,463
that are highly relevant to you
and your business,

96
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:08,802
while also protecting the privacy
of each app within that group.

97
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:14,141
This helps us meet our goals
of providing you with helpful insights,

98
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:18,478
without revealing the performance
of any individual app.

99
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,881
Let us discuss two examples

100
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,585
of how we will make the peer groups
relevant to you,

101
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:29,289
no matter what kind of app
that you have on the App Store.

102
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:34,094
First, we will use a number of attributes
that we have on the App Store

103
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,096
to create your peer groups,

104
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,199
including the app's App Store category.

105
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:43,003
For example, if you have put your app
in the travel category,

106
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,938
we will group you with other apps

107
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,509
that also put themselves
in the travel category.

108
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:53,547
Second, we will also look at
how your app monetizes on the store.

109
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,350
For example, is it a free app,

110
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,320
freemium, paid,
paidmium, or subscription?

111
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:04,024
Since apps with different business models
have different expectations

112
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,759
about user behavior,

113
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:10,564
this is also a very important factor
for creating relevant peer groups.

114
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,468
Each attribute that we use to create
your peer groups

115
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:19,173
has been tested to ensure
it allows for meaningful comparisons

116
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:23,143
over time between your app
and its peer group.

117
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,546
Next, let's talk about privacy.

118
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:30,217
At Apple, we have significant experience
with building great products

119
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,286
that also have great privacy,

120
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,023
and we used that experience here.

121
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,192
In order to accomplish our privacy goals,

122
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,361
we use a technique called
differential privacy,

123
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:44,932
which is the gold standard
for ensuring that aggregated data

124
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:50,037
can remain both helpful
and private at the same time.

125
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,074
When we calculate your peer
group's overall conversion rate,

126
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,643
we add small amounts of noise

127
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:01,181
to each data point
we share about your peer group.

128
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:05,485
We also ensure
that enough apps are in your peer group

129
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,522
so that it is not possible to know

130
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:13,427
whether a particular app is in
or out of your peer group,

131
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,597
because the noise added to the data set

132
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,201
is large enough to obscure
the exact makeup of the peer group,

133
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,238
while still providing useful information

134
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:27,074
about your peer group in the aggregate.

135
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,043
This protects the privacy of your app

136
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,046
and all the other apps in the peer group.

137
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,751
Let us end by taking a look at
how you can use other tools

138
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,153
to take action on this information.

139
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,725
The App Store provides a number
of developer features

140
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:49,530
that enable you to optimize
and improve your performance

141
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,332
across the customer lifecycle.

142
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,569
For example,
to have a great conversion rate,

143
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,639
you need to have
a great App Store product page,

144
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,409
and the App Store offers you
tools to help.

145
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,611
With product page optimization,

146
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,314
you can test different app icons,

147
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,683
screenshots, and app previews

148
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:15,689
to find out which combination of features
works best with your customers.

149
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,960
And with custom product pages,
you can create unique product pages

150
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,562
for different audience

151
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,097
that focus on their specific interests,

152
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:28,235
rather than having one product page
for all customers.

153
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:33,807
Both of these features can help you
boost your conversion rate.

154
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,410
In order to improve your usage metrics,

155
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,947
you can utilize in-app events
and App Clips.

156
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,984
In-app events are timely events
within apps and games–

157
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,019
such as game competitions,

158
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,456
movie premieres,
or livestreamed experiences–

159
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,992
that you can showcase on the App Store

160
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,730
to engage new customers
and re-engage existing customers.

161
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,933
And an App Clip is
a small part of your app

162
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:03,403
that is discoverable
in relevant public places

163
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,441
so your customers can complete
a quick task from your app.

164
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,944
For example, whether ordering take-out
from a restaurant,

165
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,214
renting a scooter,
or setting up a new connected appliance

166
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,251
for the first time,
people can launch the App Clip

167
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,854
to easily start and finish the task.

168
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,891
And finally, to improve your monetization,

169
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,426
you can try out different pricing tiers

170
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,396
so that users can customize
their experiences

171
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:34,067
based on their preferences
and the amount they want to pay.

172
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,271
Or you can create
a promoted in-app purchase,

173
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,975
which lets users browse the items for sale
directly on the App Store,

174
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,078
even before they download your app.

175
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,715
To conclude,
by combining peer group benchmarking

176
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:52,719
with other App Store tools,
you can make meaningful progress

177
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:57,191
in the areas
where your app needs it the most.

178
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:01,795
We invite you to go to
developer.apple.com/app-store

179
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,997
to learn more.

180
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,301
Here is a quick summary
of what you've seen today.

181
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,437
Peer Group Benchmarking
is an exciting tool

182
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,874
that will let you compare
your App Store performance

183
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:18,245
against a group of similar apps
on the store.

184
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,814
We have designed Peer Group Benchmarking

185
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:25,052
using differential privacy
to provide relevant insights

186
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:30,157
without revealing the information
about any individual app.

187
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,292
By using Peer Group Benchmarking

188
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:36,263
in combination with other developer
features on the App Store,

189
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:42,369
you will have the ability to boost
your app's performance on the App Store.

190
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:47,007
You will be able to start using
Peer Group Benchmarking early next year.

191
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,942
Thank you.
