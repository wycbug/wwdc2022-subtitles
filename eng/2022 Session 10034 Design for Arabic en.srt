00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,578
Hi, I am Mohamed Samir,

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,114
a designer on the Apple Design team.

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,117
Today, I'm going to walk you through
some of the best practices

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,686
when it comes to designing an Arabic app.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,857
This session is also available in Arabic,
so feel free to check it out.

7
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,027
And before we get started,
I wanted to touch on why it's important

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,264
to consider designing
or optimizing your app or game

9
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,333
to be used by Arab audience.

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,971
There is around 660 million people
that uses the Arabic script today,

11
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,807
which makes it the third most written
language in the world

12
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,976
after Latin and Chinese.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,179
People from more than 22 countries,

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,550
many cities, and regions would potentially
see and use what you've built.

15
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,419
And If you want to reach even a fraction
of that audience,

16
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,889
you would want to consider optimizing
not only for the language,

17
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,526
but also for the directionality of the UI.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,364
And this is because Arabic is a language
that is written from right to left.

19
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,967
To understand this,
let's look at this example,

20
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:11,104
that says "The Arabian desert" in Arabic,

21
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:15,108
And as you see, it's written from
the right to the left of the screen.

22
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,611
But this is not only it.

23
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,247
If this phrase exists in a layout,

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,084
the entire layout flows
from top to bottom, right to left,

25
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,121
to match the reading behavior
and direction of the language.

26
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,924
This means that things like titles,
paragraphs,

27
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,462
columns, and even imagery
should flow from right to left.

28
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:40,834
And this directionality behavior
extends beyond the layout to also the UI.

29
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,805
As in this example from the Pages app,

30
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:49,643
where the Navigation bar order
and direction is from right to left.

31
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,213
And the icons also flow
in the same direction.

32
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,482
And if you start navigating
through the app,

33
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,252
you would find menus, controls,

34
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,953
graphical elements,

35
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
and even tables have been designed
to match the natural flow

36
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,893
and behavior of the language.

37
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,229
Now, you might think that this
could be a lot of work to optimize

38
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,765
your app or game to work with Arabic,

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,302
but the good news is, a lot of this
has been taken care of by Apple

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,238
if you use our native frameworks,
like Swift UI,

41
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,742
so you can focus on the content
and few other UI details

42
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,511
that could be specific
to your app or game.

43
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,581
And in today's session I will share
with you some of these aspects

44
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,485
that you should be looking at
while doing this optimization.

45
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,520
Starting by the UI directionality

46
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,024
and example components
that you would want to consider.

47
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:40,194
Then we move to the Arabic script
main features

48
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:44,765
and the typography support
that Apple provides you for Arabic,

49
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,466
and how iconography is a detail

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,970
that enhances
the overall Arabic experience.

51
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:55,175
And at last, the numeral systems
supported by Apple for Arabic usage.

52
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,312
Let's start by the UI directionality.

53
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,781
This is an example from the App Store.

54
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,318
It is a flow that starts
by the story card in the Today tab,

55
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,789
the story page, and it ends
with the product page of an app.

56
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,358
The best way to think about
layout directionality

57
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,161
is to turn it into wireframes.

58
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,530
For Arabic,
you would want to switch the placement

59
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,399
of the UI components of these screens.

60
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,969
Some of the elements would switch
from right to left,

61
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,072
while others from left to right.

62
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:30,711
Titles, buttons, and the Navigation bar
should change order and position.

63
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,081
Paragraphs should be
always aligned to the right.

64
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:39,119
Carousals and swipeable elements
should also flow from right to left.

65
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,788
After changing the placement
of the UI components,

66
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,759
localizing the content,
and keeping the images as they are,

67
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,329
now you have a layout
that flows from right to left.

68
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,900
Changing the layout directionality
is only the beginning of your journey

69
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,936
to create an excellent
right-to-left behavior,

70
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,604
You would want to keep in mind

71
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,475
that the entire flow of the app
is now structured differently.

72
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:07,247
And the user thinks about the navigation
between these pages in a reverse order.

73
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,584
So mentally, they start
by the today tab on the right,

74
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,153
then they navigate through the story card,

75
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,089
and they end with the product page
on the left side–

76
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:20,694
as if they are navigating
through an Arabic book from right to left.

77
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,764
And as I mentioned earlier,
all of this happens automatically

78
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,500
if you use our native frameworks.

79
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,936
Now I would like to share with you
some other examples

80
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,138
for areas and components
that could be impacted

81
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,241
by changing the directionality of the UI.

82
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,245
Let's look at this example
from the Weather app.

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,881
On the left side
you see the English Layout,

84
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,117
while the Arabic layout
in on the right side.

85
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,622
The first thing that you would
notice here is content like images,

86
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,725
videos, and backgrounds remain the same.

87
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,995
In this example,
the sun always rises from the east

88
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,631
regardless the location or the language,

89
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,566
and you would want to avoid
flipping the content

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,036
so it doesn't impact
the overall experience.

91
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:09,243
The second component here is the carousal
of "the weather across the day".

92
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:13,647
Both, the interaction and the animation
of this component are inverted

93
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,583
to match the UI direction.

94
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,720
The third component that I would like
to share with you in the Weather app

95
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,488
is the temperature scale.

96
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,124
For Arabic, the lowest temperature
is on the right,

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,126
while the highest is on the left.

98
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,662
So as the scale gradient and indicator,

99
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,899
which we inverted
to match this behavior.

100
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,101
And as previously said,
the mental model

101
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,204
of switching between pages
is also reversed.

102
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,339
The primary page is on the far right,

103
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,576
and you navigate to secondary pages
on the left.

104
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:47,281
And therefore the pagination dots
should flow also from right to left.

105
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,150
And our second example here
is from the Calendar app,

106
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,654
in which the progress
and the flow of dates, months, and years

107
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,623
is from right to left
when used in Arabic,

108
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:01,495
which matches the progress
of physical calendars in the Arab world.

109
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,432
And it is always important to make sure
that your app is culturally relevant.

110
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,968
In this example here
from the Calendar app,

111
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,072
you may have noticed that there are
red lines beneath some dates.

112
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,008
These are actually used to indicate
the beginning of each month

113
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,777
of the Islamic Lunar Calendar,

114
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,015
which we have available for people
in the Arab and Islamic world.

115
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,854
The last example about directionality
is from the battery status in settings

116
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,457
where toggles, segmented controllers,
design, and interaction

117
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,994
are mirrored in the Arabic layout.

118
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,396
And also Charts is another place

119
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,533
where directionality could be impacted
in the UI–

120
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,902
especially charts that include
a time component,

121
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,539
like days, weeks, months, or years.

122
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,140
In the battery usage graph,

123
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,010
days of the week goes from left to right
in the English UI,

124
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,745
while in Arabic it is preferred

125
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,715
to have the days progress
from right to left

126
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,086
to match the calendar behavior that we
referred to in the previous example.

127
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,556
Which means that the early time would be
on the right,

128
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,592
and the late time is on the left.

129
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,062
And other charts and graphs in general
are dependent on the country,

130
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,198
so you would want to double-check
before deciding

131
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,535
on which direction to use for charts.

132
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,904
That was UI directionality.

133
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,540
Now let's talk about typography.

134
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,210
But before we dive into the typefaces
and the typestyle adjustments

135
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,813
that you would want to consider
while designing your app,

136
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,782
let me take you through
a brief introduction

137
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,653
about the Arabic script
and its main features.

138
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,623
These are four letters
that spell the word "Arabic" in Arabic,

139
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:40,727
but in writing they actually don't
mean anything on their own

140
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,896
until they get connected.

141
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,999
To understand this even more,

142
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,970
let me share with you how I would write
this word in a full Arabic sentence

143
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,439
using the iOS keyboard.

144
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,585
And as you see,
being connected doesn't mean

145
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,222
that all the letters in a given word
would be linked.

146
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,791
So this word is made of two parts.

147
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,794
Each part has two characters.

148
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,864
And this is one of the main features
of the Arabic script–

149
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,299
the connected nature of it.

150
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,202
And this also means
that the possible glyphs for each letter

151
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,138
and each pair can be many.

152
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,209
If we take the first letter here
in this example, the letter "Ain,"

153
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:33,080
its form changes based on its position
in the word,

154
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,182
whether it's isolated,

155
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,217
at the beginning of the word,

156
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,719
in the middle,

157
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,154
or at the end.

158
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,925
And it's worth noting that this
usually makes Arabic fonts libraries

159
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,894
way bigger than Latin.

160
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,365
Another feature of the Arabic script
that in most cases,

161
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,201
words are more concise than Latin

162
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,069
due to the connected nature
that tends to give

163
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,140
a more condensed feel
to words and phrases.

164
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,442
But it's also slightly taller,

165
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,378
especially with the use of dots,

166
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,481
vocalization, and diacritic marks.

167
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,350
Vocalization marks are used
to emphasize certain letters

168
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,187
or distinguish between words
that sound different

169
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,123
but would otherwise be identical
in writing.

170
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,893
And if your app would include
an intense use of vocalization marks,

171
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:24,431
make sure to have more vertical spacing
in the UI to avoid clipping.

172
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,869
Now we understand the main differences
between Arabic and Latin.

173
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,607
Let's talk about the typefaces that Apple
provides you if you use our system API.

174
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:38,345
Apple provides an exclusive
Arabic typeface that is designed carefully

175
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,748
with legibility and functionality in mind.

176
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,652
It is also designed to be consistent
with the Latin SF family style

177
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,523
to make if feel natural
in bilingual contexts.

178
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,693
And similar to Latin,
SF Arabic also provides you

179
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,696
with all possible weights
that you may need in your app.

180
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,232
from Ultralight to Black.

181
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,536
You can see the usage of different weights
in many places in our native apps.

182
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,606
The Clock app is a good example for that;

183
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,108
using Bold in the title,

184
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,644
Regular for the different cities,

185
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,280
and Light for the clock numerals.

186
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,582
You can explore more apps
in our ecosystem

187
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,051
to see how different weights can be used.

188
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,189
Like the Health app where bold,
medium, and regular

189
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,359
are used in titles and body copy.

190
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:30,063
And the Weather app where multiple weights
are used in numerals and body copy.

191
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,935
SF Arabic also has been made
with scalability in mind.

192
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,906
Which means that its form changes slightly
depending on the point size.

193
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,842
And this is what we call optical size.

194
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,710
You can see
the structural differences here

195
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:47,047
between the largest
and the smallest point sizes.

196
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,417
Large is usually used
for titles and headings.

197
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,923
And is designed to match the contemporary
grotesque feel of the rest of SF Family.

198
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,958
On the other hand, smaller point sizes,

199
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,427
which are used in paragraphs
and body copy,

200
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,766
are designed to prioritize legibility
and functionality over style.

201
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,036
This happens by adding angularity
to the terminals,

202
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:13,540
width and contrast
to the overall font structure.

203
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:16,543
It's worth noting that the system
takes care of this.

204
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:21,048
It is automatically choosing the
right form depending on the point size.

205
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,751
Here is an example from
the App Store Editorial sheet,

206
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:29,923
where we use display in the title,
and text is used in paragraphs.

207
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,793
And in both you could see how
Arabic and English typefaces

208
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,395
work seamlessly in this bilingual context.

209
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,567
SF Arabic Scalable typeface
is used across our ecosystem,

210
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:44,204
but it's also available for you
to use in your app or game.

211
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:48,475
And this year we're introducing
SF Arabic Rounded to the SF family,

212
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,379
including all its various weights,
from Ultralight to Black.

213
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,549
Here is an example from the Reminders app

214
00:11:55,582 --> 00:12:00,621
where we use SF Arabic Rounded
in the titles and the body text.

215
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,924
And as you see, Rounded could
give your app a more practical,

216
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,127
active, or softer look,
depending on the context.

217
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:12,266
The usage of the Rounded typeface,
the several weights,

218
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,538
and the scalability of SF Arabic
can all be seen in all of our native apps,

219
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,339
and we can't wait for you to use them

220
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:23,043
to create the best possible experiences
for the Arab users.

221
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,379
If you would like to learn more
about all the new fonts

222
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,782
that have been announced this year,
including SF Arabic Rounded,

223
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,684
make sure to watch this year's session

224
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,388
"Meet the expanded
San Francisco font family".

225
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,857
Now let's talk about
some typestyle considerations

226
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,760
when using Arabic typefaces.

227
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,229
Arabic is a non-case sensitive script.

228
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:47,301
Digital Arabic fonts are usually designed
to match the lower case Latin.

229
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,171
But when uppercase is used,
it gives Latin more volume

230
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:54,875
and it makes Arabic feels smaller
in comparison to Latin.

231
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,111
To compensate for this this
optical size difference in the UI,

232
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:02,716
you may want to increase
the Arabic font size by 10%.

233
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,819
This subtle difference would also help
with legibility

234
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:10,123
especially when upper case is used
in smaller point sizes.

235
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,093
The other thing to consider
is letter spacing.

236
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,529
Given the fact that Arabic is connected,

237
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,565
some Arabic typefaces
are not fully optimized

238
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,901
to deal properly with spacing.

239
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,204
This can result
in showing misplaced links,

240
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,806
breaking letters apart,

241
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,342
or showing unnecessary spacing.

242
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,312
If the Arabic typeface you're using
isn't fully optimized for letter spacing,

243
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,915
make sure to use 0 tracking.

244
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,419
or simply, use our system font,
which adds the correct letters linkage.

245
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:42,289
This linkage in Arabic
is called "Kashida"

246
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,858
and the system adds Kashidas
with different lengths

247
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:49,029
to have more organic
natural spacing in Arabic.

248
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,432
The last thing to look out for
is transparency.

249
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,469
Sometimes you can see visible joints
between letters.

250
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,505
This often happens
if there is transparency in a font

251
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:02,509
or a system
that is not fully optimized for Arabic.

252
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,478
Thankfully, if you use our system font,

253
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,346
you don't have to worry about this.

254
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,283
Opacity is applied to the entire word
or phrase

255
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,985
to overcome any potential distortion.

256
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,788
In the typography section,
I talked about the main features

257
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,356
of the Arabic script,

258
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,059
the Arabic typefaces
that we use in our ecosystem,

259
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,529
and some considerations
for certain type treatments in Arabic.

260
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,599
Now let's talk about iconography.

261
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:29,937
Iconography is one of the UI elements
that could be easily missed,

262
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,373
but they are usually the entry point
to a user flow

263
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,742
or a trigger to a certain action,

264
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,745
which makes having the correct iconography
crucial

265
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,914
to having a seamless experience.

266
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,883
For Arabic,
we are committed to choosing

267
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,286
the most relevant symbols
for our customers.

268
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,791
Let's take the App Store tab bar icons
as an example.

269
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:55,929
Some symbols have been tweaked, while
others remained the same in the Arabic UI.

270
00:14:55,963 --> 00:15:00,000
And to understand why we made this choice,
let's look at some of them.

271
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:06,406
The Today tab symbol, for example,
symbolizes text direction,

272
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,078
and it is more relevant for Arabic users
to have the lines aligned to the right

273
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,715
to match the natural reading direction
of the language.

274
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:19,553
While the magnifying glass's direction
implies the angle of the right hand usage,

275
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,823
which is the behavior of
the majority of users in the world,

276
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,491
regardless their location

277
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,594
so we decided to keep it as it is
in the Arabic UI.

278
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,798
And here some other examples
from other apps

279
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:35,402
that shows how directionality
can impact the way symbols are treated

280
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,604
in an Arabic UI,

281
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:42,609
like writing from right to left while
maintaining the angularity of the pen

282
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:46,880
or changing the speaker's direction
to make it feel natural in the UI

283
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,016
while maintaining the slash direction,

284
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:53,120
which is consistent
across our Apple ecosystem,

285
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,556
or changing the direction
of the calendar dots

286
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,025
that represent the progress of months

287
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,260
while keeping the clock hands as they are

288
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,830
to match the physical clock representation
in the system.

289
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:07,701
And on top of directionality,
having more locally relevant symbols

290
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:11,371
is another layer that we're dedicated
to enhancing over time

291
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,908
to ensure excellence
in our international markets.

292
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,778
And here are few examples
for Arabic specific symbols

293
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,680
from the SF symbols library,

294
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:23,050
including an exclusively drawn
Arabic signature symbol

295
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,953
and other text formatting ones.

296
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:30,657
All of this and more than 300 Arabic
and right-to-left symbols can be found

297
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,060
in SF Symbols app.

298
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,629
In the app you can easily choose a symbol

299
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,199
and check the localization section
in the info panel

300
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:43,804
to see the Arabic local variant
and other non-Latin scripts.

301
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,274
All of the right-to-left and the local
symbols should appear automatically

302
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,477
in your app
if you use our system API.

303
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:55,516
As we saw, using the right symbols
can transform the entire app experience,

304
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,718
as it becomes more relevant to the users.

305
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,355
And especially for countries
and regions that use a non-Latin script,

306
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,123
we need to pay more attention,

307
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:07,594
as sometimes we forget about the different
linguistic and cultural nuances.

308
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:09,997
And I really hope to see your contribution

309
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,800
in creating the most relevant icons
for the Arabic customers.

310
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,837
Now let's talk about Arabic numerals.

311
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,406
The numerals that we're all familiar with

312
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,811
and are used in most countries around
the world are called Arabic numerals.

313
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,814
And this is because they were
invented in the Arab world

314
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,751
and they replaced
the Roman numerals back then.

315
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,054
And you can notice that until today

316
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,824
all mathematical calculations happens
from right to left,

317
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:41,728
matching the reading behavior
of the Arabic language.

318
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:45,866
Like this example which starts
the summation process by ones,

319
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,670
then tens, then hundreds.

320
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:55,275
In today's world this form of numerals
is called Western Arabic numerals,

321
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,912
and that is to contrast it
with the other form of Arabic numerals

322
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,114
which is the Eastern one.

323
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,851
Both forms have been invented
in the Arab world

324
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,421
and are currently used
in different Arab countries.

325
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,924
The Western Arabic numerals is used
in West African Arab countries

326
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,795
like Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia,

327
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:19,566
while the Eastern is used in
some Levantine and gulf countries.

328
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,337
Countries like Egypt or Saudi Arabia
uses both versions.

329
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:27,407
Choosing between both systems
happens automatically

330
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,543
according to the user's country,

331
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,513
and also can be triggered
by the user choice.

332
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,581
And you can see a reflection
of this choice

333
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:38,752
in the all apps that uses numerals
in our ecosystem.

334
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,288
Including Calculator app,

335
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,490
and the Calendar app,

336
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:46,493
and the Typograph watch face
that is beautifully designed

337
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,862
in both numeral forms.

338
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:53,400
And many other watch faces that you can
check in our watch face gallery.

339
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,370
If the app that you're developing
includes numerals,

340
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,906
make sure to count for both forms

341
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,041
or to check which country you're targeting

342
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,944
to validate which form
would be more suitable.

343
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,713
And at last, if you would like to have
more design guidance

344
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,682
for right-to-left languages,

345
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,918
please refer to
our Right to Left guidelines

346
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:14,154
in the Human Interface Guidelines.

347
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:17,291
Today I talked about Designing in Arabic,

348
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:22,095
including the impact that the language
can have on the UI directionality.

349
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,931
And in the typography section,

350
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:27,034
I gave an introduction
about the Arabic script,

351
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:32,172
the typefaces,
and some Arabic UI type considerations.

352
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,374
I also talked about iconography

353
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:37,578
and how it can
transform your app experience,

354
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,714
the Arabic numerals in its both forms,

355
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,749
and the Right to Left Guidelines.

356
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,421
And if you would like to even dive deeper
into how to get all of this right

357
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,556
from a development perspective,

358
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,660
you can also check this year's session
"Get it Right (to Left)".

359
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,096
I hope all of this gave you guidance

360
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,831
and pointed you at the right tools

361
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:02,369
to start designing or optimizing
your app to be used in the Arab world.

362
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,673
And I can't wait to use all the amazing
Arabic apps that you're going to build.
