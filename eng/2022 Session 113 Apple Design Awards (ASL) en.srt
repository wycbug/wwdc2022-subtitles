just like writing a song
or write a book,

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,109

- Design influences
people's lives on all levels.

15

or having a bad one.

17

- If no design,
there will be no surprise.

- It's not just how things look,
it's how things work.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:13,240
- It's one of the most effective
forms of storytelling.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,542
- To design something,
I think we often have to kind of

21
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,811
reduce it down
to a simplified version of it.

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,047

climbing a mountain,

step by step.

24
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,984
- You get to start with, like,
a blank piece of paper

25
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,486
and then you get to turn it
into something

26
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,588
hopefully really cool.

27
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,856
- When you actually make it work
and then you show it to someone,

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,259
and they actually can use it
in a simple way,

29
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,695
when it used to be
this really complex thing,

30
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,463

really cool to do.

00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,034
to create Active Arcade.

173
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,235
Just like choreography;

174
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,037
just like teaching you
how to dance.

175
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,707
- We were in the middle
of quite a long project.

176
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,542
We realized it would be
really good fun

177
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,978
to just do a really fast project

178
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,647
and we could never
lose motivation for it.

179
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,117
- So the concept of the game
is you've murdered your husband,

180
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:08,421
and your goal is to make sure
other people don't find out.

181
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,222
[LAUGHS]

182
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,725
- The character
of Rebel Girls app

183
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:17,163
is like your feminist aunt
who is very kind

184
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,065
and who's full of stories.

185
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,737
And her goal is to make sure
that some of the best values

186
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,138
are instilled in you.

187
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,007
Empowering girls to become

188
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,877
the most confident
generation of girls.

189
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,481
- It's an app that is really
the friend you wish you had

190
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,849
when you lose a loved one.

191
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,283
It's the smart checklist

192
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,252
to telling you all the things
you need to do,

193
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,253
but at the same time,

194
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,022
only the things
you need to do right now

195
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,625
and what can wait, but also
allowing us to do it for you.

196
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,726
- For Behind the Frame,

197
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,696
it's basically
an escape room game.

198
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:54,834
Has that Ghibli kind of feel
to feel like playable anime.

199
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,171
We look at
the color scheme of Ghibli

200
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,440
and also Renaissance paintings.

201
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,545
- The idea behind Townscaper is
you just build beautiful houses.

202
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,213
That's all there is to it.

203
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,115
- The whole concept
is that you're finally

204
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,084
able to touch the artwork,

205
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,020
something that you're not
able to do in real life.

206
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,689
♪

207
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,192
- One of the biggest challenges
of designing tools

208
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,761
for creative people is that
a lot of the tasks

209
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,197
that artists want to create,
they're quite complex tasks.

210
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,866
So the challenge is
how do we take all that power

211
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,836
and make it really
usable and simple?

212
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:33,072
- It has to be easy for someone
who's jumping straight in

213
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,041
and hasn't really done
this kind of work before,

214
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,478
but it also has to be effortless
for professionals as well.

215
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,614
Making something simple
is quite complex.

216
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,185
- There are so many tiny details

217
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,688
that go into creating
an experience.

218
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,324
There was no way for it not
to feel really clunky.

219
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,460
The next four and a half years
of development

220
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,062
was a lot of kind of
stripping those things away.

221
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,399
And how do we get rid of the
things that might otherwise

222
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,768
distract people so that
they can actually focus

223
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,171
on this moment
that we're trying to create?

224
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,873
- It was incredibly hard.

225
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,842
Graphic design,
as we know it,

226
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,411
is kind of coming from
the desktop-world era,

227
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:15,615
and didn't really have a lot of
innovation in the last decades.

228
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,785
- I'd approached it similarly
to designing a building --

229
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,554
both you need
to navigate through.

230
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,922
With a website,
or even with an app,

231
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,491
you have different views.

232
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,425
You have an entrance.

233
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,860
At a certain point
you have an exit;

234
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,361
you have different rooms,

235
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,430
and the experience
needs to be good.

236
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,900
- My watercolor skills
are horrible.

237
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,770
My code development
is at the HTML levels.

238
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,874
So I also need to convince other
people, through my journey,

239
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,876
to build these things with me.

240
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:47,113
When we put it out, there was no
other watercolor game like it

241
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,681
or even watercolor app.

242
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,083
So I really worked heavily

243
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,784
with getting in
all the small details,

244
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,286
getting the water
to flow correctly

245
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,289
and getting it to just feel
really nice.

246
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,458
- Pushing the limits
has never been the problem.

247
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,693
The whole team loves to do that,

248
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,695
loves to see how far
they can take a character

249
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,798
or how much story
we can get into this scene.

250
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,233
The challenge
is to keep limits on that

251
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,835
so we can actually get it done.

252
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,638
- If you can create something
that people cannot see

253
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,807
in the real life, then sometimes
they will feel "wow"

254
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,478
at that moment
and we will feel so satisfied.

255
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,779
[LAUGHS]

256
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,550
Yeah, so this is why
we choose optical illusions.

257
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,319
For most people, when you see
some optical illusion,

258
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,787
you are just wowed.

259
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,390
- It was quite
a tricky problem to solve

260
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,659
of just making sure that
you could be playing on a bus,

261
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,794
but you don't notice
that you're on the bus anymore.

262
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,597
It's all of the little things
that build up the immersion,

263
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,065
not the big, obvious ones.

264
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,669
So the scuttling noises,
steam vents, things like that.

265
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,371
- We had huge geometries
and landscapes

266
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,007
and things that we wanted
to make really quick and custom.

267
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,510
We would just use our tool
that we designed,

268
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,446
and it would automatically
Lego-ify it.

269
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,116
- Our goal was to design
a very focused experience

270
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,252
for touch devices.

271
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,920
The player can interact
with this world

272
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,223
without having to think about.

273
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,058
That might sound simple,

274
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,927
but it's actually one of
the hardest things to pull off.

275
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,899
- Marvel Future Revolution
is an open-world, superhero,

276
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,135
action MMO RPG on mobile.

277
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,239
So it's got all your favorite
Marvel superheroes

278
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,976
saving the world with all
your buddies and friends.

279
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,477
The fact that
you could actually have

280
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,879
the true superhero experience

281
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,449
and you could actually take it
everywhere with you.

282
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,851
- I think that from
the very beginning we knew

283
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,653
we wanted to make a game

284
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,457
that was a mix
between music and story.

285
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,727
I mean, everything is in
the name of the game, you know.

286
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,263
So there's this character,
Gabrielle, who's in a coma.

287
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,934
You have to play music
to unlock memories.

288
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,371
To make this whole game,
it was a gigantic process,

289
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,907
but I mean,
it was a fantastic one.

290
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,542
- I thought,
"Cameras are so delightful;

291
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,146
maybe we can bring, like,
a semblance of that delight

292
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,015
to an iPhone camera."

293
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,517
I get emails every month --
every week, sometimes --

294
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,386
of people saying, like,
"I really enjoyed that.

295
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,553
It really helped a lot."

296
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,922
And that's so cool.
[LAUGHS]

297
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,992
- This app that we had created
actually convinced people

298
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,228
to get rid of their vehicle

299
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,030
and made riding
public transit fun.

300
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,097
And from that point on,

301
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,333
I think the motivation
became that transit

302
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,236
can have an impact on
people's transportation choices.

303
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,739
- Mental health was one
of those glowing beacons of need

304
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:31,210
where the skillset of a designer
and a product thinker

305
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,881
are deeply needed,
directing a lot of our attention

306
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,018
toward traditionally
underrepresented populations

307
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,921
and showing up in a way that,
we like to say,

308
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,092
opens a front door to care.

309
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,362
- Apps and games
have to tackle social change.

310
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,764
- An inclusive game
or app is something

311
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,033
that everyone feels at home.

312
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,535
Everyone can...

313
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,337
- ...have fun,
yet still connect with people.

314
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,107
- That authenticity allows us
not to just have

315
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,644
kind of symbolic diversity,
but actual diversity.

316
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,647
- I think if we want
to see social change,

317
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,683
then we need to exhibit it,
especially in entertainment

318
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,287
because it shows people
where we can go.

319
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,122
- I think I really
started to think,

320
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,524
"Hey, I can now make things
that help people

321
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,160
and solve the world
a little bit."

322
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,863
- I think over the last
two years, especially,

323
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,998
like, we're seeing
where we're going,

324
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,267
where we're going to spend more
and more of our lives digitally

325
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,769
in this world.

326
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:37,810
And how do we, as people, shape
those everyday experiences?

327
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,513
- A tip I could give
to the young developers

328
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,083
is stick to your original idea.

329
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,685
- If you're only
getting inspiration

330
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,187
from all the other games
that you love,

331
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,223
it's just going to be
another game.

332
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,093
- Try, fail, and try again.
And fail. And try again.

333
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,863
- Make as much as you can.

334
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,164
They don't have to be huge.

335
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,566
They don't have to be exciting.

336
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,702
But the more you make,
the more you learn how to make.

337
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,072
- When to leave it alone
and stop tinkering on it.

338
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,673
- Really figure out
what the game is

339
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,842
before bringing people on.

340
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,077
- Don't get frustrated.

341
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,112
- Let go of some
of your assumptions.

342
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,580
- Trying to decide what
the market wants

343
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,915
doesn't really make sense.

344
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,917
It's like, do something that
you're going to be motivated

345
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,785
to keep working on,

346
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,154
that you actually want
to exist in the world.

347
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,290
- You can steal,
but steal from the best

348
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,594
and always add your own
kind of magic fairy dust.

349
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,495
- Get inspired.

350
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,831
Get inspired by what's out there
and what's adjacent.

351
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,299
And look at what techniques
are in there

352
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,802
and how you can approach it
from a totally fresh start

353
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,606
with the things
and the biases that you have.

354
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:47,480
- The Apple Design Award,
it is like the Oscar. [LAUGHS]

355
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,250
- I couldn't believe it.
I was like, in tears, basically.

356
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,520
- I didn't know who I can tell.
It's like, oh my God.

357
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,990
I think something --
the most amazing thing happened

358
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,494
and there was no one in the room
I could share it with.

359
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,964
- I remember seeing
some tears in his eyes.

360
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,567
It means a lot to me as well,

361
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,003
because I was the one
that asked him to quit his job.

362
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,539
- Are they still asleep?
I mean, come on.

363
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,844
It's the Apple Design Awards
happening over here.

364
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,447
- Very first reaction
when I received the email.

365
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,616
OK, it's probably a spam.

366
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,420
Then I was like, hmm,
it's a good spam.

367
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,022
And then I started
talking about it with the team,

368
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:34,493
and, like, everyone was like,
"What?!" [LAUGHS]

369
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,363
- Well, what would I want to say
to my fellow finalists?

370
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,731
Best of luck.

371
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,067
You've built something
that's amazing,

372
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,202
whether it gets an award or not.

373
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:48,608
- And now we become the
Apple Design Awards finalists.

374
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:53,045
It's like every day I'm in
the highest point in my life.

375
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,348
- We made it!
[LAUGHS]

376
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,250
- I remember the moment
when I first heard it,

377
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,784
it was quite emotional for me.

378
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,488
So I hope they're also looking
back at their progress

379
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,258
and their work
over the last year or more.

380
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,026
- Great job and congratulations.

381
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,227
- Congratulations to everybody.

382
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,362
- Congratulations.

383
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,529
- Congratulations!

384
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,331
- It's an honor
to be amongst you.

385
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,766
- Great job.

386
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,635
And let's keep on building it.

387
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:20,773
- Your continuous work
and creation and your effort

388
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,276
will make a difference.
