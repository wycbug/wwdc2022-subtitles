00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:06,473
[spacey percussive music]

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,379
Kaely Coon: Hi, my name is Kaely Coon.

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,747
Jennifer Bush:
And I'm Jennifer Bush.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,350
We're writers here at Apple,
working as part

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,051
of Human Interface design teams

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,354
across Apple products and services.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,024
Today, we're going to share some tips
and best practices we've learned

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,426
that we hope will help you,
as developers,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,263
approach writing for your app or game.

10
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,100
Kaely: Sometimes we're called
UX Writers or Content Designers,

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,337
and what we write can be
referred to as strings, copy, or text,

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,742
but essentially, it's our job
to design through the lens of language.

13
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,280
From the earliest days at Apple,
we wanted to design devices for everyone.

14
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,416
This meant they needed to be able
to communicate with anyone.

15
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,852
The first Macs were built
on the design principle

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,422
"what you see is what you get,"
which includes the language.

17
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,993
Mac was built using simple language
that was easy to understand.

18
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,864
It focused on the person using it,
welcoming you in,

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,000
and now, across our products,
as soon as you turn them on,

20
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,703
we say "Hello."

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,241
Since those early days, we've continued
to be conversational in our interfaces.

22
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,978
When words work seamlessly with design,
you may not even notice them,

23
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,782
but they're pivotal to every part
of a user experience.

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,651
The words are there to help people
do what they want to do,

25
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:29,423
whether it's create a Memoji,
watch a movie, or find focus.

26
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,593
Let's take a look at an app
with the words removed.

27
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,529
Feels a bit empty, doesn't it?

28
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,766
In the Apple Music app, the visuals
give you a hint at what each section is,

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,037
but would you know the difference
between an album and a playlist?

30
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,407
How about how
to browse or listen to the radio?

31
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,676
Even if there aren't
a lot of words on a screen,

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,047
they help you understand what's expected,
and what to do next.

33
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,985
And if you were to come across an error,
they'd help you find your way.

34
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,722
Writing is about communicating,
which, of course, includes the words,

35
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:05,225
but it also includes the structure
of those words,

36
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,997
the timing in which they appear,
and the feeling people have reading them.

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,967
I mentioned how UX writers
designed through the lens of language.

38
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,704
Now, you may hear that and wonder,
"What does that even mean?"

39
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,674
It means the earlier you make writing
a part of the process

40
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,176
of designing your app,

41
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,946
the better the experience
will be for the people who use it.

42
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,415
In this session,
we'll walk you through the types of things

43
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,552
we consider as we develop
the words in our products.

44
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,354
They're not the only things
we think about when we write,

45
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,757
as there are often many considerations,

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,825
but we hope this provides
a useful framework

47
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,361
to keep in mind when writing for your app.

48
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:46,500
These are: Purpose, Anticipation,

49
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,936
Context, and Empathy.

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,639
You'll notice we've given
you an acronym of "PACE,"

51
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,142
which is an important thing
to consider while writing.

52
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,746
Pace is about creating a natural flow
so you keep people engaged

53
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,583
and interested
in what you're telling them.

54
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:08,088
This means knowing what to say,
how to say it, and when.

55
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,891
Now, I'll hand it to Jen
to talk about Purpose.

56
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,862
Jen: As you develop the screens
in your app,

57
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,799
think about the most important thing
someone needs to know at that moment.

58
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,402
That's the purpose of your screen.
So how do you convey that?

59
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,641
First, consider information hierarchy,

60
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,210
or how you order the elements
on the screen.

61
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,979
Here's an example.

62
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,982
This is an intro screen
for a Messages flow.

63
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,318
You know the purpose because
it's right at the top:

64
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,954
"Share Your Name and Photo with Friends."

65
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,856
You probably noticed that first.

66
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:48,695
Next, you might have read the button
that says "Choose Name and Photo."

67
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,332
We know people don't always read
the text on screen in order,

68
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,569
so make sure your headers
and buttons are clear.

69
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,707
The rest of the text on the screen
still has an important purpose.

70
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,044
It tells you what you can customize,
and that you can choose

71
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,582
who you want to share this with,
but the text is a little smaller.

72
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:13,387
The information hierarchy helps
convey this screen's purpose.

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,689
Know what to leave out.

74
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,027
When you know the purpose of a screen,
you can make choices about which ideas

75
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,930
you want to keep
in, which you can take out,

76
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,599
or which ones you can move someplace else.

77
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,635
Here's a wireframe of a made-up version

78
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,705
of a temperature warning screen
for iPhone.

79
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:36,577
The title says "iPhone Needs
to Cool Down." That sounds clear.

80
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,414
But there's a lot more text,
and this screen is trying to do too much.

81
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,951
Think about the purpose of the screen.

82
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,521
Is it to tell you
why iPhone needs to cool down?

83
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:52,793
If so, it tells you that you might
be in the sun or using too many apps.

84
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,396
Maybe it's to tell you that
you can still make an emergency call.

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,131
That button is pretty large.

86
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,503
It almost looks like the screen
is suggesting it's necessary.

87
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,606
Let's look at what we went with.

88
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,941
This screen is much simpler.

89
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,479
The headline is just "Temperature."

90
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,983
Because the thermometer image
conveys that the temperature is high,

91
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,485
we don't need to say that explicitly.

92
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,788
And the single sentence tells you
that iPhone needs to cool down

93
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,824
before you can use it.

94
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,293
The button just says "Emergency,"

95
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,562
so if you needed to make
an emergency call,

96
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,963
it would be clear what to do.

97
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,368
Rather than give too many details,
aim for simplicity.

98
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:39,072
You can tell people the purpose
of a screen; it's not a secret!

99
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,743
When introducing a new feature to someone,
for example,

100
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,279
tell them why it's there,
and why it's important.

101
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:50,617
In this intro screen with the header
"Wind Down Shortcuts," it tells you,

102
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,852
"Reducing screen time

103
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,254
is one of the best things you can do
before bed."

104
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,591
That's the purpose of this feature,
and now you know

105
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,660
why you might want to set it up.

106
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,329
Have a purpose for every screen.

107
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:07,100
When there are multiple steps in a flow,
define the purpose of the entire flow,

108
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,570
as well as each screen within it.

109
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:14,141
This can help keep screens brief
and reduce unnecessary steps.

110
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,344
At the start,
think about how to welcome people in

111
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,146
and teach them what they need to know.

112
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,617
Here are a few of the screens
in a flow designed to help you set up

113
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,485
Apple Cash for family sharing.

114
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,656
The text tells you who Apple Cash is for,

115
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,260
"family members who are under 18,"
and what they can do with it,

116
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,763
"send and receive money and use
Apple Pay for purchases."

117
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,602
In this next step,
the purpose is to let you know

118
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:46,740
what you're going to do next,
verify your identity,

119
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,811
and give you some important information
about data and privacy.

120
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,982
This privacy information takes up
quite a bit of space on the screen,

121
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,750
but it's important.

122
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,520
Privacy is one of Apple's core values.

123
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,088
Think about your app's values

124
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,190
and make sure
they're represented throughout.

125
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,995
After you verify your identity,
and you're at the end of this flow,

126
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,331
you're still not quite ready
to start using the feature.

127
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,201
This "Almost Ready" screen tells you

128
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:18,405
that the "card activation may take a few
minutes," and to expect a notification.

129
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:23,744
And here it is!
Now you can send money with Apple Cash.

130
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,581
If you're having a hard time
deciding what to write on a screen,

131
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,383
go back to its purpose.

132
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:34,488
You can convey purpose
by considering information hierarchy,

133
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:40,160
knowing what to leave out,
and having a purpose for every screen.

134
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,030
Kaely:
Next, let's talk about Anticipation.

135
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,869
It helps to think of the words
in your app as part of a conversation.

136
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:53,006
A dialogue happens
between your app and whoever's using it.

137
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,310
In any good conversation,
there's a back and forth.

138
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,981
Sometimes you're listening, sometimes
you're talking, or asking questions.

139
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,183
Similarly, in your app,
you're anticipating

140
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,419
how to best communicate for each moment.

141
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,224
Let's say it's a weekend
and you've decided to sleep in,

142
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,026
so you go to the Clock app
to change your alarm.

143
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,829
You want to make sure you're changing
the alarm just for tomorrow,

144
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,097
not your whole schedule.

145
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,934
The action sheet asks,
"Would you like to apply this change

146
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,669
to all weekends in this schedule?"

147
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,640
The first selection is
to "Change Next Alarm Only,"

148
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,475
anticipating that most of the time,

149
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,379
you're likely to just be thinking
about tomorrow's wake-up.

150
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,682
When you head to bed,
the lock screen says "Sleep Well"

151
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,418
and tells you that Sleep Focus is on.

152
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:42,489
The small button shows you
that your alarm is set for 8:30 AM.

153
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,192
"Sleep Well" has
a friendly and familiar tone,

154
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,428
and acknowledges
that you're going to sleep.

155
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,731
The next morning, if you get up
before the alarm

156
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,499
and start using your iPhone,

157
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,903
it anticipates that you might not want
that alarm to sound.

158
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,805
So it asks, "It looks like you're awake.

159
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,808
Would you like to turn off
your alarm and sleep mode?"

160
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:06,180
The conversation feels intuitive, like
your device is speaking to your needs.

161
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,415
When it comes to being conversational,

162
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,985
writers talk a lot about voice and tone.

163
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,323
Develop your app's voice first,
and then you can vary its tone.

164
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,661
Start by asking yourself:
what would it say and not say?

165
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,031
Are you developing a game
that's exciting and fun?

166
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,968
Is it a banking app that needs
to be secure and trustworthy?

167
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,237
Is it an app that's kid-friendly?

168
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,073
Think about who you're talking to
to help figure out the type

169
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,209
of vocabulary you'll use.

170
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,945
Make a list of commonly used terms.

171
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,114
This can help shape the voice
that you can also use for your website,

172
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,283
emails, and other communication.

173
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:47,588
Anticipating what people are going through
helps you consider your tone.

174
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:51,491
Here, Apple Watch says,
"It looks like you've taken a hard fall"

175
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,494
and if you're okay,
you can answer, "I'm okay."

176
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,065
The tone is calm and clear
in what could be a stressful moment.

177
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,502
Apple has one consistent voice
that you'll recognize

178
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,737
no matter which
of our devices you're using,

179
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,307
but our tone changes
depending on the situation.

180
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,177
Think of how your tone of voice
changes when you pick up the phone

181
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,347
and talk to your friend versus,
say, your bank.

182
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,684
Here, in the Activity app on Watch,
when you've set a Move streak,

183
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,653
it says, "You set a personal record

184
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,923
for your longest daily Move streak:
35 days!"

185
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,060
The tone is quite celebratory,
so it has an exclamation point.

186
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,029
Be careful how often
you use those, though.

187
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,731
They can look silly when they're frequent.

188
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,969
When writing for apps,
you always have to ask, "What comes next?"

189
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,473
Anticipating the next action
or question someone's going to have

190
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,208
will help you know what to say.

191
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,578
In the Breathe app on Apple Watch,
the instructions tell you

192
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,347
to "Be still,
and bring your attention to your breath."

193
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:53,921
You might not be sure how to start
doing that, so then it says, "Now inhale…"

194
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,389
"And exhale."

195
00:10:55,422 --> 00:11:00,460
It answers your question of how to use it,
as the visuals reinforce the message,

196
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,830
and the watch vibrates
to help with timing.

197
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,568
And in this example from Maps,
when you're likely to be heading home,

198
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,672
you see a notification that tells you
about your commute: "8 minutes to Home"

199
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:15,108
and to "Take Audubon Ave,
traffic is light."

200
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,446
It helps you make a decision
by anticipating what you'll do next.

201
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,049
When design
and text work closely together,

202
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,785
an app feels seamless as you use it.

203
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,387
Anticipation is about thinking of your app

204
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,523
as being part of a conversation.

205
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:35,329
Develop your voice and vary your tone
according to the situation.

206
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:40,133
Then answer
the question of what comes next.

207
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,670
Speaking directly to people
in the right way is one way to take

208
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:47,474
your app experience from functional
to magical.

209
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:51,378
Jen: Next, we'll cover context.

210
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,214
Start by thinking outside the app.

211
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,417
When someone uses your app,
are they likely to be at home

212
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:01,188
in a quiet space,
or traveling at busy airport?

213
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,892
Are they occupied with something else,
like driving or cooking,

214
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,561
or can they give
your app their full attention?

215
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,297
This reminder shows up on your Apple Watch

216
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,868
if it notices that you're exercising,
but haven't started recording the workout.

217
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,471
The context is, you're on an outdoor walk,

218
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,274
so you don't want
to have to stop to read a lot.

219
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:25,612
There's one large button
clearly labeled "Record Outdoor Walk."

220
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:30,217
On the other hand, once you stop
exercising, your context has changed.

221
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,519
You can take in
a little bit more information,

222
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:36,156
like your total distance,
average pace, and active calories.

223
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,861
Here, when taking a panorama photo,
your focus is split

224
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,298
between the camera app and whatever
you're trying to photograph.

225
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,668
An on-screen arrow guides you
with instructions,

226
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,771
to "Move continuously
when taking a Panorama."

227
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:55,242
The words appear right below the arrow
because that's where you're looking.

228
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,479
Now let's talk
about how to write helpful alerts.

229
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:03,217
Chances are, your app has some alerts,
which are best used

230
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,154
when you want someone to confirm
an action or make a choice.

231
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:12,292
They are, by their context, interruptions,
so you want your alerts to be helpful

232
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,560
and clear.

233
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,530
In this alert,
you've opened the Weather app,

234
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,867
and it needs permission
to use your location.

235
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,505
Because it appears at the time
you open the app, it feels contextual.

236
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:28,775
The alert also gives you the context
in which the permission will be used:

237
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,012
to show local weather
and send relevant notifications.

238
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,351
Some alerts
might have a destructive action,

239
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:41,788
or something that can't be undone,
like removing a device from your account.

240
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,024
Let's take a closer look.

241
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,960
This alert asks the question
"Remove iPhone?"

242
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,298
And the buttons answer
with Remove or Cancel.

243
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,135
The context here is that someone
needs to make an important choice,

244
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,005
one in which they may lose information.

245
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:03,110
"Remove" is the destructive action,
so its button is red and on the left.

246
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,246
The "Cancel" button is on the right
and dismisses the alert

247
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,681
without taking any action.

248
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,085
But be careful how you use Cancel.

249
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,756
As you can see in this fake alert
for a made-up subscription,

250
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,659
the title of "Confirm Cancellation"

251
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,228
makes it hard to know which button
to choose,

252
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,230
the one on the left that says "Cancel"

253
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,133
or the one on the right
that says "Confirm."

254
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:30,571
The rest of the text reads,
"If you confirm and end this plan now,

255
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:34,842
you'll lose access on June 21, 2022."

256
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,510
This isn't giving much more help.

257
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,914
It's unclear whether you're ending
this plan now

258
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,050
or if you can still access it.

259
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,619
The phrase "this plan" is also vague,

260
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,088
especially if you have
more than one subscription.

261
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,860
With a few small changes, we can fix it.

262
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,063
This new title
of "Cancel Platinum Subscription?"

263
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,466
tells you which subscription
you're canceling and matches well

264
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,570
with the buttons labeled
Cancel Subscription or Keep Subscription.

265
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,007
The message body is brief,
telling you

266
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,411
that "You'll continue
to have access until June 21, 2022."

267
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,414
You'll notice that the buttons

268
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,650
aren't labeled Yes and No.

269
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,953
When writing for alerts,
it's always best to be specific

270
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,689
about the action
the buttons are going to take.

271
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,859
On this alert, if you only read
the button labels,

272
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:28,061
you would still understand
what you were choosing.

273
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,166
Another context for seeing an alert
is when something goes wrong.

274
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,869
Errors will often show up as alerts,
as shown

275
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,138
in this pretty unhelpful made-up example.

276
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:43,777
The title of "Oops! you can't do that"
doesn't say what it is you can't do.

277
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,715
You're unlikely to know
what the error code 1234567 means,

278
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,718
and the rest of the message,
"Sorry, bad input.

279
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:54,888
Please try again,"
doesn't add any information.

280
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:58,859
And it's unclear why there
are two buttons, Okay and Cancel.

281
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,528
It seems like they'd both do
the same thing.

282
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:05,899
As for the tone of the message,
interjections like "oops!" or "uh-oh"

283
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,534
can sound patronizing,

284
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,804
and "please" and "sorry"
can sound insincere.

285
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:12,606
Use them sparingly.

286
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,610
Here's an example of a better message.

287
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,580
The title clearly tells you
there's a billing problem,

288
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,783
and the text explains
exactly what to do about it.

289
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,053
To continue
accessing your subscription,

290
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,955
add a new payment method.

291
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,592
The top button, Add Payment Method,
takes you right to where

292
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,060
you can fix the problem,

293
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,262
and the second button, Not Now,

294
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,699
lets you continue what you were doing
so you can come back later.

295
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:42,703
Now let's talk
about how to create useful empty states,

296
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,073
or places in your app
where there isn't any content.

297
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,943
Empty states can be times for education
or even celebration,

298
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,913
like when you complete the last item
on your to-do list,

299
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,215
but it depends on context.

300
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,117
Here's another example.

301
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,952
In this made up restaurant app,

302
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:01,855
you haven't saved anything
to your favorites.

303
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,925
It uses the title
"Nothing strike your fancy?"

304
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,027
which has a whimsical feeling.

305
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,830
That can work
if it matches the voice of your app,

306
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:14,134
but the idiom might not be
universally understood or translate well,

307
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,603
and the text,

308
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:19,306
"Please come back if you do find
something you want to eat,"

309
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,409
doesn't give any useful guidance
or indication of how content

310
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,510
might show up here.

311
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:28,081
On the other hand,
the Apple Podcasts library

312
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,618
clearly tells you that you have
"No Saved Episodes."

313
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,121
It then explains that you can

314
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,723
"Save episodes
you want to listen to later,

315
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,592
and they'll show up here."

316
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,194
Much better.

317
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,830
So to recap, when thinking about context,

318
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,566
think outside of the app,

319
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,268
about what else people
might be doing while using it.

320
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,374
Write helpful alerts that are contextual
and offer clear choices.

321
00:17:56,043 --> 00:18:00,047
And create useful empty states
by using an appropriate tone

322
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,782
and giving helpful guidance.

323
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,419
Kealy: Finally, let's talk about empathy.

324
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,057
In user experience writing, having empathy

325
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,893
means you should aim
to write for everyone.

326
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,463
Your app might have a specific audience,
like musicians,

327
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:20,701
gamers, or other developers,
and you should speak to them,

328
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,403
but you don't want leave anyone out.

329
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:29,109
It's best to use simple, plain language,
as idioms and humor can be misunderstood

330
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:33,347
or not translate, and some phrases
have meanings that exclude people.

331
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:39,319
A key aspect of empathy is
being responsive to localization needs.

332
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,855
Your app could be used
by people all over the world.

333
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,057
That's an exciting opportunity!

334
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:48,362
It also means your app needs to adapt
to a lot of languages and cultures.

335
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,366
When you translate
from one language to another,

336
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,102
words can get longer or shorter.

337
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,038
Some languages
require more vertical space.

338
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,439
Someone could be using your app

339
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,742
with a language that reads
from left to right,

340
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,343
or right to left.

341
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,778
Here's an example.

342
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,815
This is the confirmation you see
when changing languages on iPhone,

343
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,884
in this case, from English to Thai.

344
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,121
In English, the notification reads,

345
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,224
"Applying this setting will restart
your iPhone,"

346
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,993
with the buttons
Change to Thai and Cancel.

347
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,997
In Thai, the text
at the top is a little longer,

348
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,367
and the space
accommodates the taller characters,

349
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,270
while in Dutch, the text is much longer.

350
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:35,242
The space at the top grows
so the text can continue to a second line.

351
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,846
And here's Hebrew,
a language that reads right to left.

352
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:43,483
There are also considerations
beyond just word length.

353
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,718
In U.S. English,

354
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,054
the calendar abbreviations
for the days of the week

355
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:52,893
are a single letter, M for Monday,
T for Tuesday, and so on.

356
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,763
But in Catalan,
the days of the week are abbreviated

357
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,865
to two letters--

358
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:01,101
there isn't a single-letter variation--

359
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,605
while in Arabic, the days of the week
are not abbreviated at all.

360
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,842
Your UI needs to be able to adapt
to those language changes.

361
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,979
Now let's talk about accessibility.

362
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:15,916
It's important to welcome
everyone into your app.

363
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,685
For your app to be used
by as many people as possible,

364
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,055
it needs to speak
to as many people as possible.

365
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:25,759
Someone who is blind or has low vision,
for example, may set their device

366
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:30,030
to display bold or larger text,
or use VoiceOver to navigate.

367
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:35,035
Pay attention to the language you use
for labeling the elements in your app.

368
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,605
Those words will be some people's
entire experience using it,

369
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,974
and you want
that experience to be well designed.

370
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,679
Every element needs to have thoughtful,
useful, descriptive text.

371
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,849
This includes not just
the Voice Over text for navigation items,

372
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:54,922
like links and buttons, but any symbols,
graphs, or images as well.

373
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,559
Let's look at how Voice Over
describes a few Memoji Stickers.

374
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,329
This first one is described
as "Person tilting head to the side

375
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:05,532
with hand beside mouth
as if sharing a secret."

376
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,802
Notice that it isn't just
the physical details that are described,

377
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,338
but the intention,
"as if sharing a secret."

378
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,475
The second is described
as "person meditating

379
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,312
with relaxed arms
and forefingers touching."

380
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:23,350
Again, both the physical details--
relaxed arms and forefingers touching--

381
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:26,086
and the context
of meditation are described.

382
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,490
And the third example
again describes both context

383
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:34,261
and position:
nervous person biting fingernails.

384
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,098
Notice also that each of these examples
is described as a "person,"

385
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,667
not, say, a "man" or a "woman."

386
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,270
You can also help everyone
feel welcome in your app

387
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:47,374
by avoiding unnecessary references
to specific genders.

388
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,844
Be equally thoughtful
about any descriptive language you use.

389
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:55,415
It's critical to use empathy
when writing for your app.

390
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,051
Write for everyone, using simple language.

391
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:03,123
Be responsive to localization needs,
including text size changes.

392
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:07,194
And design for accessibility,
using thoughtful text

393
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:10,130
for people who use VoiceOver to navigate.

394
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,900
Don't be afraid to review
your app's language often,

395
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,401
and change things.

396
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:18,872
Just as language evolves more broadly,
so should the words your app uses.

397
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:21,775
There is so much more
to know about these topics.

398
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,244
Check out the Human Interface Guidelines
to learn more

399
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,079
about designing inclusive apps.

400
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:31,351
Today, we talked about Purpose,
Anticipation,

401
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,887
Context, and Empathy,

402
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,591
four concepts you can use to make sure
the text in your app or game

403
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,760
is well designed.

404
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,896
We hope you saw the value
of considering writing early,

405
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,367
as part of your design process,
not as something you fill in later.

406
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:50,838
Jen: And if you do find yourself
struggling to find the right words,

407
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:54,041
we have one last tip for you,
and it's the simplest one:

408
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:56,577
read your writing out loud.

409
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,180
It can really help make sure
your writing sounds conversational,

410
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,748
like how you'd talk to a friend.

411
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:07,087
Reading out loud can also help you
find unnecessary or repetitive words,

412
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,356
grammatical mistakes, or typos.

413
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,924
Those details matter.

414
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,127
Kaely: Writing for interfaces
begins with curiosity

415
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,597
for who's on the other side of the screen.

416
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,499
Speak to them
with respect and understanding,

417
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,768
and we know you'll find the right words.

418
