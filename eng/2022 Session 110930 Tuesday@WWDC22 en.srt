Ready for your day two briefing?

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:09,042
Let's jump right in, shall we?

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,577
First, we cooked up new ways

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,247
to navigate within
your SwiftUI apps.

6
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,716
- This recipe is our
pièce de résistance.

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:19,519
Then we learned more about
the new features in Xcode 14.

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,188
- You can choose
the level of detail

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,789
that's right for you.

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,625
And Jared showed us
new plug-ins

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,995
for adding Apple frameworks
to your Unity game projects.

12
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,998
- The Core Haptics Unity plug-in
gives you the tools you need

13
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,501
to add an entirely new level
of immersion into your games.

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,237
- And there's a brand-new
way to do 3D scans

15
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,572
with RoomPlan.

16
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,474
- Apple has enabled
powerful new ways

17
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,043
for people to bring the world
into their apps.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,945
And then Paul showed
developers how they can

19
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:49,049
use color to make SF Symbols
even more expressive.

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,885
And we introduced the new
Push to Talk framework for iOS.

I'll be ready in a few minutes.

Over.
