Hi! My name is Bea, and I'm
a human interface designer

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,648
on the Documentation team.

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,251
I'm going to share how to
improve the discoverability

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,920
of your Swift-DocC content.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,390
In this session, I'll talk about
the new navigation experience

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,294
available for Swift-DocC
documentation on the web

9
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,730
and share tips for how
to optimize your content

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,499
for discoverability.

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,836
If you need some additional
context on what Swift-DocC is

12
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,305
and how you can make
great documentation

13
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,774
for your frameworks
and apps with it,

14
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,910
check out these other
WWDC sessions.

15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:49,416
Now, let's jump in and check out
the new navigation on the web.

16
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,452
This year, when you publish
your documentation site,

17
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,254
you get a new
navigation experience

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,658
that brings out
the best in your content.

19
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,227
The page contains
two main sections.

20
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,764
To the left is a navigator
and filter bar that allow you

21
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,999
to navigate through
your documentation

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,502
and find APIs quickly.

23
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,004
To the right
is the content view.

24
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,941
It's optimized to be flexible
in multiple screen

25
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,276
and navigator sizes.

26
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,912
Since the navigator
is separate from the content,

27
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,749
it's easy to quickly switch
between different pages.

28
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,885
You can also use
the disclosure indicators

29
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,687
to explore deeper
in the tree

30
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,623
and understand
the API hierarchy.

31
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,725
All of these features
make it way easier

32
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,361
to explore documentation.

33
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,863
On the other hand, if you know
what you're looking for

34
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,466
and you want to get there
as quickly as possible,

35
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,035
you can use the Filter bar
to refine the results

36
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,204
in the navigator.

37
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,773
Let's see the filter in action.

38
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,910
Let's say that
you're looking for "Habitat."

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,145
When you click on
the Filter bar and type that in,

40
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,181
you'll get a filtered view
of the pages

41
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,651
you actually care about,
right now.

42
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,121
You can clear the filter
to reset the navigator.

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,191
And you can also filter
to see articles, tutorials,

44
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,829
and even hide deprecated pages
by selecting tags.

45
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,898
For example, if you select
the Tutorials tag,

46
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,967
it's super convenient to find

47
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,671
the "Meet SlothCreator"
tutorial.

48
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,208
Now that you're up to date
with what's new in navigation,

49
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,643
I'm going to talk about
how to make the most

50
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,679
out of this new experience.

51
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,281
Here are some tips and tricks
for how you can optimize

52
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,118
your content so developers
find the pages

53
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:35,155
they're looking for
as smoothly as possible.

54
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,225
Let me show you how
I optimized the documentation

55
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,828
for my framework,
SlothCreator, as an example.

56
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,197
You can use SlothCreator
to catalog sloths

57
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:49,136
you find in nature and to create
new, adorable virtual sloths.

58
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:52,139
I just finished working
on my framework documentation,

59
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,141
so I haven't written
any markdown

60
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,543
to organize my pages yet.

61
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,512
As a starting point,
I'm taking advantage

62
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,682
of Swift-DocC's
automatic organization.

63
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,352
This means my navigator
is organized by types,

64
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:12,192
like tutorials, articles,
protocols, and structures.

65
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,363
This is already a great start,
but I can do a better job

66
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,299
guiding developers
through my documentation.

67
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,003
To optimize my content,
I'm going to follow three steps.

68
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,341
First, define the main
high-level themes

69
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,944
of what I can do
with this framework.

70
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,049
Then, I'll organize my pages
by importance and specificity.

71
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,753
Last but not least,
I'll optimize my group titles

72
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:44,091
to make sure they're as clear
and helpful as possible.

73
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:48,428
I think of this process
as creating a map.

74
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,997
It helps people
understand the boundaries

75
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,366
and general characteristics
of a region

76
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,070
and figure out how to get
from one place to another.

77
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,140
Likewise, the documentation
navigator helps developers

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,843
understand what you can do
with a set of APIs

79
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,746
and how to navigate to the pages
they're looking for.

80
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,583
I'll start by helping developers
understand what they can do

81
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,986
with my APIs by defining
the main high-level themes

82
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,422
of SlothCreator.

83
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,058
These themes will show up
on the navigator

84
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,693
on the SlothCreator page,

85
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,395
the top-level page
of my documentation.

86
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,831
It'll be one of the first things
developers see

87
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,901
when they land
on my documentation website.

88
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,138
This is my opportunity
to make a great first impression

89
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,740
and help developers
have a good understanding

90
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,843
of what this framework does.

91
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,412
Now, let me think
about my first theme.

92
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,948
One of the main functionalities
of SlothCreator

93
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,451
is creating sloths.

94
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,722
They have names, colors,
and even special powers.

95
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:53,660
To summarize, I'll call this
topic group "Sloth Creation"

96
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,096
Later, I'll decide what pages
to include in this group,

97
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,965
so I'll just leave
a placeholder for now.

98
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,902
After you create a sloth,
you can visualize it

99
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,838
in many different ways,
like on an app screen,

100
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,706
in a map view.

101
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,577
I'll call this "Sloth Views"

102
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,713
And of course,
sloths are a lot of work.

103
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,751
They need to be fed,
entertained, taken care of.

104
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,188
I'll call this "Management"

105
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,056
There's already
a lot of functionalities

106
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,192
you can achieve
in these three groups.

107
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,527
And putting myself
in the shoes of a developer

108
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,996
who's never used
SlothCreator before,

109
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,965
I'd love to have
an easy way

110
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,101
to see how to get started
with this framework.

111
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,804
With this in mind,
I'll create a topic group

112
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,274
with high-level
introductory content.

113
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,744
I'll call it "Essentials."

114
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,148
Awesome! Even though
there are hundreds of things

115
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,117
you can do with SlothCreator,
I'm only highlighting

116
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,956
the four most important,
overarching topic groups.

117
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,458
By reducing the number
of options that are available,

118
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,161
I'm increasing
developers' chances

119
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,297
of successfully taking
the next step.

120
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,234
There's no magic number
for how many topic groups

121
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,202
I should create,
but I generally try

122
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,772
to stick to under
10 per page.

123
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,774
Thinking back
to the idea of a map,

124
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,510
I want to give developers
step-by-step guidance

125
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,479
on where they can go next.

126
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,784
The order of my groups is vital
to create a great experience.

127
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,720
Taking another look
at my topic groups,

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,022
they're mostly in a good order.

129
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,024
First, you have
to create a sloth,

130
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,861
then you can visualize it,
then you can manage it.

131
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,030
The only thing
I'd change here for now

132
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,600
is moving Essentials
up to the beginning of the list,

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,437
so developers see
that beginner content first.

134
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,307
Now, it's time to decide
the pages and themes

135
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:51,578
that should be organized under
each one of these categories.

136
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,780
Let me start with Essentials.

137
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,815
This will be at the very top
of the navigator

138
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,119
and probably one of the first
things developers will see.

139
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,221
So I want to make sure
this features

140
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,325
the most important
introductory content.

141
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,060
This is a great spot
to highlight

142
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,996
introductory articles
and tutorials.

143
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,064
This enables developers

144
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,000
to find step-by-step
code examples quickly,

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,072
which is, personally,
my favorite way to learn.

146
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,740
With these considerations
in mind,

147
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,144
I decided to organize
three groups under Essentials:

148
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,080
the "Meet SlothCreator"
tutorial,

149
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,816
the "Getting Started
with Sloths" article,

150
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:34,854
and the Sloth struct, one of
the core APIs in my framework.

151
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,591
I'll repeat this same process
for the three other groups.

152
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,828
This feels approachable
because I see the most important

153
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,763
and broad themes first.

154
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,532
As I explore deeper in the tree,

155
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,069
the groups get more specific
and advanced.

156
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,371
For instance, inside Essentials,

157
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,673
I'll find
Getting Visual Attributes.

158
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,942
And inside
Getting Visual Attributes,

159
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,713
I'll find
Getting the Standard Colors.

160
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,382
Great, my documentation
is organized in a way

161
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,885
to guide developers through
the content successfully.

162
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,089
Next, I want to make sure
the titles of my topic groups

163
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,324
are also high quality.

164
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,561
The first characteristic
to a great topic group title

165
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,398
is that it should be
clear and descriptive.

166
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,101
A good title makes sense
on its own

167
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,471
and doesn't need much
additional context.

168
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,206
Thinking back
to my topic titles,

169
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,775
there's some room
for improvement.

170
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:32,345
The last topic title I wrote
is "Management."

171
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,148
This group of APIs is all
about what you can do

172
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,651
to manage your sloth's
well-being: Activity,

173
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,989
CareSchedule, FoodGenerator,
and Sloth.Food.

174
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,492
At first glance,
this seems like a good title.

175
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,596
However,
upon further consideration,

176
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,631
"Management"
is such a broad term;

177
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,901
it could mean a ton
of different things.

178
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,603
So it's not ideal.

179
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,105
To make this clearer
and more descriptive,

180
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,776
I'm going to call it
"Care and Feeding."

181
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,778
Now, I understand
this group is all about

182
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,248
taking care of my sloths
and giving them food.

183
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,550
For that reason,
it's also important

184
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,387
that topic group titles
be mutually exclusive.

185
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,256
If I have titles
that are interchangeable,

186
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:20,860
it's hard to know which one
contains what I'm looking for.

187
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,363
For example,
Fueling Superpowers,

188
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,366
Getting Magical Abilities,
and Casting Enchantments

189
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,134
are very similar themes

190
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,605
and could probably be organized
under a single title.

191
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,075
By keeping the names as
mutually exclusive as possible,

192
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,911
I'm making it simpler
for developers

193
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,280
to figure out
where to go next.

194
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,384
The more work I put into
organization and page titles,

195
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,021
the more likely developers
will have a smooth path

196
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,123
to the page
they're looking for.

197
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,092
Also, the more likely
I'll encourage serendipity;

198
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,763
in other words,
happy accidents.

199
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,632
By organizing well-thought-out
themes next to each other,

200
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:05,004
I'm enabling developers to find
relevant, related pages.

201
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,641
For example, as I'm learning
about SlothCreator Essentials,

202
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:14,147
I'm delighted to find Getting
Magical Abilities in the list.

203
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,849
All of these tips and tricks

204
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,651
really brought my documentation
to the next level.

205
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,321
It's so much better!

206
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,824
Now, let's review how you can
improve the discoverability

207
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:29,395
of your content and make it
approachable for developers.

208
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,000
First, identify the main themes
of your documentation.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,138
Then, organize your content
by importance and specificity.

210
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,009
Next, encourage serendipity,
by organizing related themes

211
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,878
next to each other.

212
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,915
Last but not least, write clear,
mutually exclusive titles

213
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,951
for your pages and groups.

214
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,620
Thank you for taking the time

215
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,923
to learn how to make
your documentation better.

216
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,059
I'm sure developers
will deeply appreciate it.

217
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,761
Have a great WWDC!
