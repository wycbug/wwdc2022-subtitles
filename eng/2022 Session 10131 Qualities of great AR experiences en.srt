Welcome to "Qualities of
great AR experiences."

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,282
I'm Alli Dryer, and I'm part of
the Apple Design team

5
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,485
working on augmented reality.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,688
AR lets you deliver experiences
that blend virtual objects

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,956
with the real world,

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,526
creating the illusion that
these objects actually exist.

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,629
AR can be
surprisingly immersive,

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,097
and yet at the same time,

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,267
it's always grounded
in what's really happening.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,735
It allows you
to visualize things

13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,204
that would be impossible,
risky, or hard to do

14
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,640
from a practical standpoint.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,175
Blurring the line between
imagination and reality,

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,345
an AR experience
really feels like magic.

17
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,547
You can completely transform
people's surroundings

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,084
through visuals and sound so
they experience something new.

19
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,087
You can also add new layers of
information to the environment

20
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,724
to enable quick and lightweight
interactions.

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,494
Designing for augmented reality
can be very different

22
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,596
from designing
for 2D applications,

23
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,998
but don't worry,
we'll break it down here.

24
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,035
Today I'm going to share
criteria you can use

25
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:11,238
to decide if AR is right for
the experience you're building,

26
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,207
along with tips for handling
some of the unique aspects

27
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,209
of augmented reality
when you're designing

28
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,912
your first AR experience.

29
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,315
OK. So you're designing
an app or feature

30
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,017
and wondering whether AR
makes sense for you.

31
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,219
Here are a few things
to consider.

32
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,856
AR can help you deliver
a true representation of things.

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,091
To show what I mean,

34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,361
let's look at an example of
something AR does really well,

35
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,230
which is to present the
real-world size of an object.

36
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,865
Say you're trying
to educate people

37
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,168
about how big a dinosaur is.

38
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,171
You could just write it out,

39
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,574
or show a picture,

40
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,411
or you could unleash
a virtual T. rex on the scene.

41
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,447
In that case,
there's no need to imagine

42
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,282
how big the dinosaur is.

43
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,050
The AR experience
gives the viewer

44
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,353
an instant,
visceral sense of scale

45
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,655
in a way that's
truly immersive.

46
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,091
This example comes
from the app Monster Park,

47
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,493
a game that lets people
explore and control

48
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,896
the movement of animated
three-dimensional dinosaurs.

49
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,398
It's fitting that the entire app

50
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,501
revolves around this
large-as-life AR experience,

51
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:20,007
also emphasizing the creation of
photos and videos for sharing.

52
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,176
AR is at its most delightful
when it affects and responds

53
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,312
to what's immediately
around you,

54
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,415
involving physical space
in a meaningful way.

55
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,017
Say you're trying
to design an app

56
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,919
that helps with interior design,
and you want to help people

57
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,122
choose a paint color
for their walls.

58
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,425
You could use swatches
or stock photography,

59
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,327
but those aren't very accurate.

60
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,095
Even better,
you could show someone

61
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,864
how their very own
room would look

62
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,166
with freshly painted walls.

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,435
The Color Snap app
does just that.

64
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,303
It allows people
to choose a paint color

65
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,973
and then tap a wall
to preview the effect.

66
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,308
Because it's AR,
people can move around

67
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,444
to see how the new color
will affect their space

68
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,312
from different vantage points.

69
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,983
Next, augmented reality
allows you to create experiences

70
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,919
that visualize
virtual objects in 3D,

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,256
which makes it easier
to understand and evaluate them.

72
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,793
With AR, you can build features
that help people try on things

73
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,128
in a way that's virtual
yet realistic enough

74
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,165
for someone to make
a confident purchasing decision.

75
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,067
For example,
the Warby Parker app

76
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,235
lets people try on
virtual glasses

77
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,004
so they can place an order
knowing exactly

78
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,605
how their frames will fit.

79
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,175
It's faster to switch between
frame styles in AR

80
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,144
than it would be
to swap glasses in real life.

81
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,946
Grounding virtual objects
in the scene

82
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,948
is also really important.

83
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,951
The quality of lighting
and shadows in your experiences

84
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,454
can have a huge impact
on people's feeling

85
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,055
that things are really there,

86
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,958
even when an object
isn't very realistic.

87
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,094
The IKEA Place app
allows people to place

88
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,429
a piece of virtual furniture
in their home

89
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,530
and get a more accurate sense

90
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,599
of what the updated room
would look like.

91
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,535
IKEA Place takes advantage of
ARKit's built-in lighting

92
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,904
for realistic shadows
that really settle

93
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,874
the virtual furniture
into the room.

94
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,143
Visualizing in 3D
can refer to objects,

95
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,345
but don't forget about
using people's surroundings

96
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,482
as a canvas
for your experiences.

97
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,418
You can create new features
with advanced visual effects,

98
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,254
provide maps and 3D models
that fit your brand,

99
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,157
and even bring people's spaces
into the game you're building

100
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,393
with iOS's new RoomPlan API.

101
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,696
We've got a session
on creating 3D room scans

102
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,397
that goes into detail
about RoomPlan

103
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,399
if you want to learn more.

104
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,535
AR lets you streamline actions

105
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,638
by attaching digital
capabilities to physical things,

106
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,407
making your apps and features
more efficient.

107
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,775
You might have
already experienced

108
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,678
how using the real world
as input can speed things up

109
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,482
if you've ever scanned a code
to order at a restaurant.

110
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,919
You can use AR to build compact
yet incredibly useful features

111
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,721
that save people time.

112
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,024
In iOS's Measure App,
centering the camera on a person

113
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,594
automatically displays her
height in just the right spot.

114
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:58,231
The experience feels lightweight
because there's very little UI,

115
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,567
the interaction is based
on device movement,

116
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,671
and the measurement information
disappears after you've seen it.

117
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,507
This AR experience
would be too limited to offer

118
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,210
as an app on its own,
but it really complements

119
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,280
the other capabilities
of the Measure app.

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,683
So, now you know you can use
AR for your apps and features

121
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,519
when you want to deliver
a true representation,

122
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,322
involve physical space
in a meaningful way,

123
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,925
visualize in 3D,
and streamline actions

124
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,961
by making use of what's in
the environment.

125
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,664
And as you can see, there are
a lot of different ways

126
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,967
to incorporate AR into
the experiences you're creating,

127
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,036
whether it's as
the main focus of the app

128
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,573
or with a lighter hand as
a feature that reduces friction.

129
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,809
So, you've decided AR
is right for your purposes

130
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,845
and now it's time
to get started with design.

131
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,414
When you're designing for AR,

132
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,482
you'll need to consider
some of the aspects

133
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,286
that make it different
than traditional 2D interfaces.

134
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:57,023
AR is spatial.

135
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,894
AR is movement-based.

136
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:05,265
And AR is tied
to the physical environment.

137
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,968
You'll need to think about
how to blend virtual elements

138
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,470
into the scene,
about ergonomics,

139
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,473
and about working
with a limited field of view.

140
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,475
Now I'll go through tips
you can keep in mind

141
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,712
when designing AR experiences.

142
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,814
People using your app
might be in places

143
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,649
that are difficult for AR,

144
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,651
so what you can do
to help is coach them

145
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,721
through different ways
to get to a better experience.

146
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,823
The Mission to Mars app
does a great job

147
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,691
of getting people
set up for success

148
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,727
with a strong coaching sequence.

149
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,664
Let's take a closer look
at this example.

150
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,898
As you're getting started,

151
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,234
Mission to Mars highlights
three different requirements

152
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,271
you need in your environment
to have a great session.

153
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,107
First, there's a reminder
that AR can be immersive,

154
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,277
and it's wise to find
a safe place to engage with it.

155
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,811
This can be a particular concern

156
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,180
for experiences
that involve wayfinding,

157
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,749
where you'll need
to take extra care

158
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,917
not to draw people's
attention to the screen

159
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,021
for long periods of time.

160
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,456
Next, the app suggests
that AR performs best

161
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,225
on surfaces with texture,

162
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,362
rather than on glass or
smooth white featureless planes.

163
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,630
LiDAR can help overcome

164
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,999
some of these challenging
environmental conditions,

165
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,035
so you might be able
to omit this suggestion

166
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,070
for some devices.

167
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,272
And last, Mission to Mars
advises people

168
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,975
to find a bright space
because AR works best

169
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,011
in environments
that are properly lit.

170
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,747
What's great about this coaching
sequence is that it's quick,

171
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,283
easy to navigate,
and helps people understand

172
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,920
how to set up their environment
for the best AR experience.

173
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,923
The next tip is to take
advantage of screen space.

174
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,225
You'd be surprised
how large a role it can play

175
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,394
in AR experience design.

176
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,596
So, what is screen space?

177
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,498
Think of screen space
as a 2D layer

178
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,767
that sits on top of
the three-dimensional world

179
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,969
that's captured by
your camera view.

180
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
It's best to place text
and interactive elements

181
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,474
like buttons
here in screen space,

182
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,776
rather than in the 3D world
of the camera

183
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,812
to preserve legibility.

184
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,181
Here's a great example
from the Mission to Mars app

185
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,818
that illustrates how to handle
text in screen space.

186
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,488
High-contrast text and buttons
sit in a 2D screen space layer

187
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,024
on top of the 3D scene below.

188
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,260
The text updates as the camera
moves to help you understand

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,864
how it relates to the 3D objects
in the scene.

190
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,667
If you do need to lock your text
to something in the world,

191
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,169
try to keep it billboarded
or parallel to the screen

192
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,838
when possible.

193
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,840
Focus on increasing contrast,

194
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,642
bumping up type sizes
and putting text on a background

195
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,512
so you can maintain
accessibility.

196
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,647
Design for constant movement.

197
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,249
It's important
that people understand

198
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,718
how and when to move
their devices.

199
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,754
Sometimes they'll need
to move their bodies as well

200
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,523
in order to experience AR.

201
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,291
Try to provide
real-time feedback

202
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,994
with visual effects and sound
as people move,

203
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,363
so that even if the action
is taking place out of view,

204
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,534
people can still connect
with the experience.

205
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,203
Use simple, glanceable
instructions and animations

206
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,272
to coach people how to move.

207
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,775
It helps to place instructions
in screen space

208
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,812
and to show them on an as-needed
basis, rather than all up front.

209
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,815
It's great to leverage the
built-in coaching animations,

210
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,551
but you can also create your own
onboarding instructions

211
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,886
that relate to your app,

212
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,088
like this example
from the app DoodleLens

213
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,190
that shows an iPhone
panning back and forth

214
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,492
in front of a doodle.

215
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,997
Ergonomic considerations
are really important for AR.

216
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,899
It can be exhausting
to hold your arm out

217
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,667
for long periods of time,

218
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,269
and uncomfortable
to reach for buttons

219
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,306
that aren't positioned properly
for one-handed use.

220
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,143
Emphasize legibility at arm's
length for the entire interface.

221
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,779
Simplify interactions
so that they can be completed

222
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,648
with minimal effort.

223
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,617
Use oversized buttons
with high-contrast icons

224
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,387
that are easy to tap
one-handed with a thumb.

225
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,389
Here's a nice example
at the bottom of the screen

226
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,091
in DoodleLens.

227
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,060
People are viewing
AR experiences

228
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,595
with a limited field of view

229
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,630
offered through
a handheld device,

230
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,766
so there's a good chance
they might not be able to see

231
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,168
the full extent
of something large.

232
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,871
There's also a possibility
that a virtual object

233
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,874
might be located out of view.

234
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,443
Allow people to adjust
the scale of an object,

235
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,645
in case they're not
able to back up far enough

236
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,747
to see the whole thing.

237
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,783
This example from AR Quick Look

238
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,086
uses a pinch gesture
for direct manipulation.

239
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,489
There's also a haptic
so that you can feel it

240
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,426
when you scale something
past 100 percent.

241
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,362
When something is out of view
to the right or to the left,

242
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,298
use sounds and haptics
and provide simple indicators

243
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,568
or text instructions
in screen space.

244
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,770
It can also be helpful
to provide a map

245
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,607
or bird's-eye view
showing someone's orientation

246
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,742
and illustrating
that the object is located

247
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,978
in the opposite direction.

248
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,347
In this example
from the RoomPlan experience,

249
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,983
the small 3D model drawing
at the bottom of the view

250
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,885
helps you preview your results

251
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,288
and keep track of what has
been scanned so far.

252
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,824
It can be difficult for people
peering through a screen

253
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,827
to understand the location
of virtual objects in space

254
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,196
unless they're behaving
realistically.

255
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,065
Depth cues that help people see
how far away things are

256
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,967
can help with this.

257
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,537
The size of objects,
perspective effects

258
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,639
like diminishing
towards the horizon,

259
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,541
realistic shadows and lighting,

260
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,776
the proper amount
of detail in your textures,

261
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,212
and overlapping objects
create a feeling of depth

262
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,749
and help people perceive
spatial relationships.

263
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,485
I want to highlight one depth
cue that's tricky to work with

264
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,320
but can really
help people understand

265
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,056
where things are located
relative to each other:

266
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,459
overlapping,
also known as occlusion.

267
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,096
Here's an example of overlapping
you can see in AR Quick Look.

268
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,265
The virtual airplane
seems like it's positioned

269
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,367
behind the wooden blocks
on the desk

270
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,003
because the lower part of it
is hidden.

271
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,539
Finally, craft experiences
that last

272
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,575
no more than a minute or two.

273
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,110
This is for the ergonomic
reasons I mentioned earlier,

274
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,048
but also because AR is
a resource-intensive superpower

275
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,352
that has a big impact
on battery and thermals.

276
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,055
If you do end up creating
a longer experience,

277
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,357
make sure that you
build in breaks.

278
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,160
For All Mankind: Time Capsule
is an AR experience

279
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,697
that allows you to explore
the For All Mankind universe.

280
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,498
The app complements
the TV show,

281
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,935
telling stories through
interactive objects.

282
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,937
Time Capsule is
presented in chapters

283
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,572
that provide moments of rest

284
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,376
and a place to pause
then return to the experience.

285
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,312
Today I shared tips to help
overcome some of the challenges

286
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,848
with working on AR features.

287
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,250
You've learned to guide people
to the right environment,

288
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,219
to take advantage
of screen space,

289
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,021
to design for constant
movement,

290
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,157
to think about ergonomics
and a limited field of view,

291
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,327
to use depth cues, and to limit
the duration of the experience

292
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,830
to keep people
from getting fatigued.

293
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,699
Augmented Reality feels
like magic when it's useful,

294
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,636
delightful, and relates
to the physical world.

295
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,771
AR allows you
to see virtual objects

296
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,140
or even to transform
your environment.

297
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,176
You can attach digital
capabilities to physical things

298
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,480
to create a layer of useful
information and actions.

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,582
The AR features and apps
that you create

300
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,818
will transform how people work,
learn, play, shop,

301
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,687
and connect with the world.

302
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,222
I can't wait to see
what you'll build next

303
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,690
in augmented reality.

304
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,158
Thank you!
